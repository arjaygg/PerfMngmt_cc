## Evidence Sources
- Self-Evaluation (07/16/2025) and Impact Statement — AI-assisted modeling/ETL, documentation acceleration
- Peer/Stakeholder feedback — Peter Helli, Anna Liu, Christopher Jan Riños, Jegs Saylon, Patrick Oniel Bernardo, Nenissa Malibago
- 9-Box — Updated to Box 8 (High Performance / High Potential) based on H1 outcomes and leadership signals
- Strategy alignment — ABC 2025 pillars: AI-Augmented Delivery, Engineering Excellence, Stakeholder Visibility
- Team artifacts — ERDs, process flows, AI playbooks/templates, parameterization guidance for SSIS

## Key Judgement Calls
- Elevate rating within EE band (4.2) to maintain cohort distribution while recognizing enterprise enablement impact
- Update 9-Box from earlier mid-bucket to Box 8 based on sustained delivery, peer leadership endorsements, and scope expansion
- Emphasize enablement outcomes (standardization, documentation, review rigor) as primary driver of enterprise impact

## Risks / Watchouts
- Concentration risk on AI standards ownership — mitigate via cross-training and documented playbooks
- Communication length in live forums — maintain concise updates and explicit decision asks
- Scale risk — ensure validation automation keeps pace (schema diffs, static checks, parameterized pipelines)

## Next-Quarter Actions
- Standards Council: formalize AI-assisted development council; publish v1.0 playbooks with adoption and ROI metrics
- Cross-Team Design Reviews: run biweekly sessions; track rework reduction and cycle-time impacts
- Validation Automation: expand quality gates (schema diffs, static checks) and embed in CI for data pipelines
- Leadership Pipeline: delegate briefings and reviews to senior ICs to build second-line leadership

## Follow-ups (Metrics)
- Adoption: # teams using playbooks; # PRs referencing standards; attendance at reviews
- Quality: rework rate, defect escape, validation gate pass/fail, cycle-time deltas
- Communication: average time-to-unblock for cross-team issues; EOD update cadence consistency

## Recognition
- Nominate for innovation/quality recognition; feature AUC AI enablement case study in engineering forum
- Visibility: include outcomes in monthly executive summary and team-wide showcases

## Development Priorities
- Communication precision and time-boxing for leadership forums
- Broaden data-model references (Beta, SAS) to accelerate normalization choices
- Expand automation coverage and reporting dashboards; sustain parameterization-first patterns

## Retention Considerations
- High-impact multiplier; leadership-ready signals confirmed by peers/stakeholders
- Continued scope expansion via standards and cross-team forums recommended
