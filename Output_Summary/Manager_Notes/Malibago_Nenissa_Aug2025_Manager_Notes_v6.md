## Evidence Sources
- Self-Eval (07/08/2025) — AI tooling, pod leadership, documentation  
- Cross-functional inputs — Product, OS collaboration notes  
- Team artifacts — Data Manual Deployment, Source Column Guide, ERD/Modeling guides

## Key Judgement Calls
- Keep at 3.0 for cohort consistency; recognize leadership via scope and documentation quality.  
- Prioritize analytics skill growth to expand impact breadth.

## Risks / Watchouts
- Documentation currency/versioning; assign owners.  
- Time pressure recurring near sprint-end; sustain quality via early involvement.

## Next-Quarter Actions
- Python learning plan with applied dashboards; share outcomes.  
- Onboarding pack for data modeling pod; define adoption KPIs.  
- Add validation to AI-generated scripts (schema diffs, checks).

## Follow-ups
- Track documentation usage/adoption; review quarterly.  
- Monitor sprint-end load and upstream planning touchpoints.

## Recognition
- Recognition for enablement systems and reliability under pressure.
