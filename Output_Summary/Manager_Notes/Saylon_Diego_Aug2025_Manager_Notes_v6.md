## Evidence Sources
- Self-eval (07/08/2025); v6 evaluation; peer inputs (collab, communication); delivery metrics

## Key Judgement Calls
- Maintain 4.0 for SE cohort parity; reliability and collaboration are consistent strengths.

## Risks / Watchouts
- Avoid diffusion; protect focus while helping others.  
- Grow architectural perspective without reducing throughput.

## Next-Quarter Actions
- Lead a 6–8 week mini-improvement (checklist + tests) with outcome metrics.  
- Demo approaches and publish quick-start guides.  
- Join design discussions to broaden system view.

## Follow-ups
- Measure bug-rate/cycle-time deltas; feedback from consumers of guides.

## Recognition
- Recognition for dependable collaboration and predictable delivery.
