# Manager Notes (Confidential) - v6
## Rio Alyssa Venturina - OutSystems Developer
### Review Period: Jan 1, 2025 - Jun 30, 2025

---

## Recommended Actions
- Assign ownership of a small component/workstream to build leadership muscle
- Schedule a brownbag on OS troubleshooting and reusable components
- Provide time to harden test strategy (unit/integration) for owned modules

## Evidence Sources
- Peer feedback indicating dependable delivery, clarity, and support (Glizzel Ann Artates, Nymar Fernandez)
- PBI histories and documentation updates across sprints
- Contributions to reusable components and team how-tos

## Follow-Ups
- Identify component to own and draft plan (scope, quality gates, docs) (due: Q3 W4)
- Prepare and deliver brownbag with examples (due: Q4 W2)
- Pair with senior engineer for cross-cutting feature exposure (schedule across Q4)

## Risks / Mitigations
- Risk: Underexposure to cross-team initiatives → Mitigation: assign cross-functional task with PO/QA coordination
- Risk: Limited visibility → Mitigation: regular status summaries in stand-ups and sprint reviews
