## Manager's Confidential Assessment

Myra is a exceptional hire who has exceeded all expectations for someone with less than 4 months tenure. Her natural Product Owner capabilities combined with strong technical skills and automation mindset make her a valuable asset. The tenure-based rating cap is unfortunate but necessary per policy.

High potential for rapid advancement. Should be fast-tracked for development opportunities. Risk of losing her if not properly recognized and developed. Consider all available tools for retention and engagement.

The fact that she's already served as Product Owner backup and created significant automation tools in under 4 months is remarkable. With proper nurturing, she could be a future technical leader or product leader in the organization.

**Recommended for high-potential program once eligible.**
