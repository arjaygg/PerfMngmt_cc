## Evidence Sources
- Self-eval (07/08/2025); peer inputs (innovation, documentation, leadership signals); automation artifacts

## Key Judgement Calls
- Tenure policy cap to 3.0 despite EE-level impact; communicate trajectory and growth plan.

## Risks / Watchouts
- Avoid overextension; ensure ownership scope matches tenure and support.

## Next-Quarter Actions
- Begin AWS/Azure certification track and apply learnings to tooling.  
- Own a medium-complexity initiative end-to-end with stakeholder map.  
- Expand documentation/training to org-wide audience.

## Follow-ups
- Track initiative delivery quality/timeliness; certification progress; peer feedback on collaboration.

## Recognition
- Call-out for automation and AI enablement; earmark for accelerated growth plan.
