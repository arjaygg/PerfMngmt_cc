## Evidence Sources
- Self/impact statements; peer inputs (DevEx impact; documentation; fast ramp); CI/CD artifacts

## Key Judgement Calls
- Tenure < 6 months (hire: 2025-03-06 per roster). Calibrated overall must be max 3.0 despite exceptional impact. Document as Exceeds-level performance under cap with clear progression plan.

## Risks / Watchouts
- Visibility vs ownership balance; ensure scope growth paced with support.

## Next-Quarter Actions
- Formalize DevEx standards (release notes, load testing, pipelines) with adoption metrics.  
- Lead two enablement sessions; draft TechRadar governance.  
- Pair with senior on strategic architecture exposure.

## Follow-ups
- Track adoption across teams; DX Core 4 signal (lead time/defects); stakeholder feedback.

## Recognition
- Recommend recognition for cross-org impact; plan accelerated path post-cap window.
