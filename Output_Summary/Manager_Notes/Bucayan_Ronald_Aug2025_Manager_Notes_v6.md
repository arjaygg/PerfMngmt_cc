# Manager-Only Notes (Private) — Ronald Bucayan v6

Confidential. Not for employee distribution.

## Evidence Sources
- Self-evaluation PDF (Calculated rating 2.83; goal-level detail; period 01/01–06/30/2025)
- Peer Feedback Workbook (July 2025): Entries 35, 51, 61, 77, 110, et al. indicating leadership, enablement, responsiveness
- Strategy deck: ABC Tech Strategy & Execution Plan 2025 (pillars, DX core, BFS objectives)
- 9-Box sheets: Individual Contributors (Ronald: Perf 4.00, Pot ~2.6; 9-box 6); Risk/Loss/Impact sheet confirms high bucket, replacement difficulty hard
- Team roster: Hire date May 2024 (>12 months) — tenure rule allows >3 rating if warranted

## Calibration Rationale
- Self 2.83 skews low vs peer endorsement and technical output; engineering outcomes and enablement justify 3.0
- Forced distribution: middle band fit; v6 keeps rating stable vs v5 while sharpening development plan
- 9-Box: Cell 6 consistent with solid performance, moderate potential; gaps are strategy-linked (BFS/AI, empowerment)

## Key Strength Evidence (retain for talent review)
- Environment access enablement (upper env) → reduced dependency and cycle time (APW/UI)
- ADO dashboards improving throughput/WIP visibility
- Features shipped: SSE callback for orders, SAML SSO, WebSocket integration (OS)
- Cross-team workshop led (OS for AUC) — positive reception and pull-based interest

## Development Risks / Mitigations
- Risk: Strategy misalignment (BFS, AI) — Mitigation: 90-day BFS uplift target, AI pilot committed
- Risk: Over-reliance on personal delivery — Mitigation: ownership rotation, weekly mentoring cadence, RACI clarity

## Follow-ups (dates owner: manager)
- D+14: Confirm BFS curriculum enrollment; pick 2 BFS flows and define acceptance metrics
- D+30: Approve AI pilot scope (small, observable) and success criteria
- D+45: Review empowerment metrics (ownership rotation roster; mentoring logs)
- D+90: Evaluate BFS first-pass acceptance uplift and rework reduction; adjust plan

## Talking Points for 1:1 (not to share as-is)
- Acknowledge engineering excellence and leadership presence called out by peers
- Frame gap as visibility to strategy (BFS/AI, empowerment), not capability
- Co-create metrics he owns: BFS FPA uplift, empowerment coverage %, AI pilot outcome

## Promotion/Comp Note
- Maintain calibration in middle band until BFS/empowerment signals are durable; revisit next cycle if metrics achieved.
