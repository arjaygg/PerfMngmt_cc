## Evidence Sources
- Self-eval (08/06/2025); peer feedback (helpful, needs consistency); manager observations

## Key Judgement Calls
- Hold at 3.0 for cohort parity; focus on execution reliability and scoped ownership.

## Risks / Watchouts
- Inconsistent status signaling; late artifacts.  
- Research not translating into shipped outcomes.

## Next-Quarter Actions
- 30-day Windsurf+OutSystems POC with README/demo; weekly status.  
- Two measurable contributions tied to team OKRs; pair reviews for consistency.  
- Define acceptance criteria per PBI template; proactive risk signaling.

## Follow-ups
- Track on-time delivery rate, POC adoption, PR review quality.

## Recognition
- Recognition for team support and component help; encourage demo culture.
