## Confidential Assessment Summary
High-impact DevOps contributor with strong reliability engineering outcomes and broad team enablement influence. Ready for expanded ownership in reliability and enablement programs. Calibrated at EE to maintain distribution balance and parity with cohort.

## Key Strengths (Confidential)

### Reliability & Scale
- Cluster Autoscaler and HPA adoption across services improved availability and reduced manual toil
- Calm incident handling; consistent off-hours responsiveness; drives post-incident clarity

### Enablement & Mentoring
- Proactive knowledge sharing (AI tools, CI/CD, K8s); approachable and hands-on
- Recognized by peers as go-to for unblocking and guidance (Rex, Joebert, Cleo, Delson feedback)

### Delivery Discipline
- Maintains momentum amid external blockers (e.g., network cabling delaying Rancher cutover)
- Balances central DevOps obligations with project-level support

## Development Areas (Confidential)

### Communication & Visibility
- Earlier surfacing of infra dependencies and risks; publish one-page rollout plans with owners/fallbacks
- Bi-weekly stakeholder updates for significant changes; standardize change templates

### Scale Through Delegation
- Convert enablement topics into mentee-led sessions; create reusable guides/runbooks

### Formalization
- SLOs/error budgets for key services; incident class runbooks and prevention actions

## Performance Calibration Rationale
- Forced distribution: middle 70%; 9-Box at 6.0 supports EE  
- Peer group parity: EE consistent with Sr DevOps cohort and tenure  
- Self 4.65 normalized to 4.0 given role distribution and calibrated coordinates (Perf 3.0, Pot 2.0)

## Development Plan (Confidential)

### 0-30 Days
1. Publish AI usage quick-guide (3–5 patterns) and DevOps change template
2. Draft one-page rollout plan template; apply to next two high-risk changes
3. Identify 2 mentees; assign monthly enablement topics

### 31-90 Days
1. Lead reliability initiative (SLOs, runbooks, prevention actions); monthly stakeholder readouts
2. Rotate mentee-led enablement; capture artifacts in repo wiki
3. Pilot bi-weekly platform status summary to POs/QA/Dev leads

### 91-180 Days
1. Expand autoscaling patterns with error budgets and rollback criteria  
2. Present reliability outcomes and adoption metrics in QBR forum  
3. Propose next-phase enablement roadmap (CI/CD quality gates, golden paths)

## Risk Assessment (Confidential)

### Retention Risk: LOW
- Engaged, high ownership; growing scope opportunities are motivating

### Performance Risk: LOW-MEDIUM
- Execution is strong; risk is over-reliance on individual expertise vs. shared runbooks and delegation

### Succession Risk: MEDIUM
- Clear successor development needed (e.g., Delson, Cleo) for coverage during absences

## Manager Actions Required

### Immediate
1. Review reliability initiative charter and success metrics  
2. Approve time allocation for enablement artifact creation  
3. Nominate mentees and confirm rotation plan

### Ongoing (Weekly/Bi-weekly)
1. Status checkpoint on rollout plans and risk surfacing  
2. Review enablement artifacts; ensure clarity and reusability  
3. Track stakeholder feedback on communication cadence

### Monthly
1. Reliability KPI review (SLO compliance, incident classes closed)  
2. Mentee progression and coverage readiness  
3. Update 9-Box notes if scope expands materially

## Success Metrics (Confidential)
- 100% high-risk changes use one-page rollout plan  
- 3 priority services with SLOs, runbooks, and prevention actions in 90 days  
- Two mentees deliver at least one enablement session each per quarter  
- Bi-weekly platform status readouts delivered for two consecutive months

## Notes for Next Review Cycle
- Assess durability of enablement via mentee ownership  
- Evaluate reliability KPIs trend and incident prevention effectiveness  
- Consider scope elevation to Reliability/Platform Lead based on outcomes
