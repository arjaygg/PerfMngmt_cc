---

## Key Organizational Outcomes (anchor points)
- Evaluation throughput: 30/39 completed; 9 pending
- Calibration controls active: tenure caps, forced distribution, role parity, 9-Box
- AI adoption ~95%; collaboration effectiveness ~92%; strategy alignment ~78%
- Quality signals: >95% coverage in critical systems; defect reduction noted
- Reliability/compliance: patching cadence maintained; no material audit findings reported

---

## Recognition Opportunities (VP impact framing)
- Institutionalize "standards + evidence": PR addendum (risk/edge-cases, tests/coverage)
- Recognize tenure-constrained high performers; accelerate scope and development plans
- Highlight Box 8/9 pipeline and succession moves to executive stakeholders

---

## Risks and Mitigations
- Retention risk from tenure caps and distribution constraints
  - Mitigation: recognition tracks, accelerated scope, early-tenure policy refinement proposal
- Expertise concentrated in a few individuals
  - Mitigation: deputies assignment, cross-training, documentation gates
- Standards adoption variability
  - Mitigation: adoption gates, review cadence, KPI dashboards per team

---

## 30/60/90-Day Follow-Ups
- 30 days:
  - Complete remaining v6 evaluations; validate distribution and 9-Box
  - Publish PR template addendum; begin adoption tracking
  - Conduct retention/recognition follow-ups with constrained high performers
- 60 days:
  - Launch AI template packs; set review SLAs and report adoption
  - Define outcome KPIs per team; integrate into dashboards
  - Document deputies/backfills for critical roles; start cross-training
- 90 days:
  - Run quarterly architecture/strategy forum; capture actions/owners
  - Codify bias-checklists and decision records for calibration
  - Present early-tenure policy refinements for executive review

---

## Evidence-to-Narrative Mapping (for self-evaluation)
- Strategy execution: calibration guardrails, distribution integrity, succession pipeline
- Engineering excellence: testing/integration standards, DevOps playbooks, logging
- Talent development: leadership candidates identified, mentoring moments, onboarding playbooks
- Visibility: sprint reports, dashboards, executive briefings; calibration transparency
- Governance/risk: policy enforcement, patching cadence, audit readiness

---

## Open Items to Monitor
- Completion of all 9 pending v6 evaluations with consistent rationale
- Adoption metrics: PR addendum usage; AI template pack uptake; KPI dashboards
- Succession artifacts: deputies/backfills documented for critical roles

---

## Talking Points (executive reviews)
- "We raised baseline quality via standards and visible evidence, while protecting fairness through calibration and policy controls."
- "Retention risk centers on constrained high performers; recognition and accelerated scope are in flight alongside policy refinement proposals."
- "Next cycle focuses on adoption gates, measurable KPIs per team, and formalized succession to reduce single-point dependencies."
