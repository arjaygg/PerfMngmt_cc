# Manager Notes (v6) â€“ John Mark Arguilles

- Key strengths: collaboration with BA/QA/API, steady delivery, clean-code focus
- High-signal evidence: pairing on complex items; adherence to team practices; cross-role coordination
- Risks/Watch: delayed blocker surfacing; limited pre-task design articulation
- Next actions:
  - Own a small KPI-linked improvement (e.g., rework reduction on a module)
  - Add brief design notes before complex items; capture outcomes after pairing
  - Increase proactive updates on risks/decisions
- Follow-ups:
  - Review improvement metrics and adoption of notes templates
