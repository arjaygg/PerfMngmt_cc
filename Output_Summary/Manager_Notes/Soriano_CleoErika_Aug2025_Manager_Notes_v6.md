# Manager Notes (Confidential) - v6
## Cleo Erika Soriano - DevOps Engineer
### Review Period: Jan 1, 2025 - Jun 30, 2025

---

## Recommended Actions
- Approve CKAD exam + study time; schedule weekly K8s labs
- Assign lead for one service’s full Kubernetes cutover (plan → rollout → runbooks)
- Schedule two KT sessions: K8s deployment patterns; incident prevention in pipelines
- Recognize health check leadership and containerization enablement in team forum

## Evidence Sources
- Daily health-check and Dynatrace alert remediation records (Clearing APIs)
- Stand-up notes and shared links for new tools/findings
- Dockerization/Kubernetes migration tasks and documentation artifacts
- Peer feedback (Orlando Suarez, Angel Jaramillo, Edgar Avalos, Ian Abellana) highlighting reliability, collaboration, and enablement

## Follow-Ups
- Create standardized deployment/runbook template for services (owner: Cleo; due: Q3 W4)
- Draft SLI/SLO proposals for two critical services; review with team (due: Q4 W2)
- Track CKAD prep progress; target exam in Q4

## Risks / Mitigations
- Risk: Over-reliance on senior teammates for decision checkpoints → Mitigation: define clear ownership for the K8s cutover and decision logs
- Risk: Documentation time pressure → Mitigation: carve out weekly documentation block; reuse templates
