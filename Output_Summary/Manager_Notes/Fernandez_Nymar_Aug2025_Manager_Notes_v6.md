## Evidence Sources
- Self-Eval PDF (07/08/2025) — reusability, Copilot usage  
- Peer/stakeholder input — collaboration, adherence to requirements  
- Team artifacts — reusable dropdown component, checklist updates

## Key Judgement Calls
- Keep 3.0 per cohort consistency; emphasize enablement impact over individual throughput metrics.  
- Develop shared ownership of components to increase potential trajectory.

## Risks / Watchouts
- Reusable components require tests/docs to avoid regressions.  
- Balance helping others with maintaining own delivery predictability.

## Next-Quarter Actions
- Publish docs and tests for key reusable components; add usage examples.  
- Lead a lightweight bug-rate reduction effort (review checklist + focused tests).  
- Run monthly knowledge share on component design and effective Copilot prompts.

## Follow-ups
- Track component adoption and defect rates; capture consumer feedback.  
- Review time allocation to sustain predictable delivery.

## Recognition
- Team forum shout-out for reusability mindset and collaborative support.
