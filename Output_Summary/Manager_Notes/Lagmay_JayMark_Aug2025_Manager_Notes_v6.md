## Evidence Sources
- Self-Eval (07/08/2025) — coverage results, engagement, recruiting  
- Peer notes — testing framework impact, mentoring  
- Tooling — SonarQube coverage/gates, CI pipeline status

## Key Judgement Calls
- Hold at 4.0 for Sr SWE parity despite standout testing gains to preserve cohort distribution.  
- Emphasize scale-out of framework and mentoring curriculum.

## Risks / Watchouts
- Framework adoption without coaching may degrade quality.  
- Avoid over-indexing on testing at expense of architecture involvement.

## Next-Quarter Actions
- Template the testing framework; coach two services through adoption.  
- Lead design reviews on target microservices; record decisions.  
- Formalize interview/mentoring curriculum and outcome measures.

## Follow-ups
- Adoption metrics: services onboarded, gate pass rates, defect escape trend.  
- Mentoring impact: interviewer readiness, time-to-autonomy.

## Recognition
- Public recognition for testing excellence and mentoring contributions.
