# Manager Notes (v6) â€“ Ian Abellana

- Key strengths: platform reliability, automation, AI enablement; consistent ownership; cross-team unblocker
- High-signal evidence: AI access + tracking; autoscaling + HPA rollout; training + change management; timezone coverage
- Risks/Watch: external infra dependencies; ensure enablement artifacts reduce person-dependence
- Next actions:
  - Publish enablement kits (AI usage patterns, scale guardrails, deployment recipes)
  - Formal mentorship loop for DevOps cohort; succession coverage
  - Lead architecture reviews for capacity and reliability patterns
- Follow-ups:
  - Confirm rollout timeline for additional clusters; telemetry standardization plan
  - Track adoption metrics post-enablement
