# Manager Notes v6 â€” Reyes, Christopher (Confidential)

- Key risks: Narrow backend exposure; ensure breadth to reduce single-threading.
- Evidence sources: Self-eval (07/08/2025), peer feedback (docs, ceremony initiative), onboarding assets.
- Actions next 60 days:
  - Minimal automated checks for high-churn screens (smoke set); publish.
  - Formalize onboarding pack template; hand off to next new hire.
  - Shadow complex backend flow with SME; summarize learnings.
- Follow-ups:
  - Review doc/automation impact metrics (defect escapes, time-to-onboard) monthly.
