## Evidence Sources
- Self-Eval PDF (07/16/2025) — AI-assisted modeling and transformation achievements  
- Stakeholder feedback — Product/QA on design-review effectiveness  
- Team artifacts — ERDs, process flows, AI guidelines, SharePoint documentation

## Key Judgement Calls
- Maintain 4.0 for parity within Technical Lead cohort while recognizing organization-wide AI impact.  
- Innovation recognized via org-level visibility and reusable standards rather than rating uplift.

## Risks / Watchouts
- Innovation concentration risk: broaden ownership to prevent single-point dependency.  
- Sustain quality as scale-out accelerates; avoid undocumented pattern divergence.

## Next-Quarter Actions
- Lead standards council for AI-assisted development; publish v1.0 playbooks.  
- Run two cross-team design reviews per month; track rework reduction and cycle-time deltas.  
- Expand validation automation for data pipelines (static checks, schema diffs).

## Follow-ups
- Adoption metrics: % teams using AI playbooks; # PRs referencing standards.  
- Quality metrics: rework rate, defect escape, cycle time pre/post.

## Recognition
- Nominate for Innovation/Quality award; feature case study in engineering town hall.
