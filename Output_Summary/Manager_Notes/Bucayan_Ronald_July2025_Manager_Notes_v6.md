# Manager Notes v6 – Ronald Bucayan (Confidential)

Date: 2025-08-13
Manager: Arjay Gallentes

## Recommended Actions
- Communication discipline: enforce daily async status and explicit end-of-day handoff when needed; weekly stakeholder digest (progress, risks, next steps).
- Metrics: track personal lead time, rework/defects tied to owned items, code review iteration count; review biweekly.
- Knowledge sharing: publish short playbooks for common APW OS issues; run 1 brown-bag on AI usage tied to BFS user stories.
- BFS/AI: pilot 1–2 enhancements (e.g., Copilot-assisted scaffolding metrics, BFS validation helpers) with observed cycle-time or defect signals.

## Evidence Sources
- Self-Evaluation PDF (08/13/2025) – updated goals/competencies narrative.
- Peer Feedback spreadsheets – entries from Duran, Pamintuan, Alix, Saylon, Becker, Solayappan; multiple strong-collaboration and responsiveness notes; isolated prompt-status feedback.
- Strategy 2025 – BFS mastery, engineering excellence, stakeholder visibility pillars.
- 9-Box IC sheet – Perf 3, Pot 3; tenure ~9–10 months.

## Follow-ups
- Week 1: adopt status/handoff ritual; share first stakeholder digest.
- Week 2: baseline metrics; pick AI/BFS enhancement candidate; draft playbook outline.
- Week 4: review metrics trend; confirm enhancement impact; schedule brown-bag.

## Risk/Watch Items
- Ensure prompt status reporting to avoid day-lag on blockers.
- Balance helping others with maintaining visibility on own deliverables; use lightweight trackers.

## Calibration Notes
- Tenure cap applied; forced distribution checked; peer themes corroborate EE signals in problem solving and stakeholder engagement, but breadth/duration align to M overall.
