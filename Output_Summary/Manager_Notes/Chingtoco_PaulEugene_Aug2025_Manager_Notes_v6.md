**Manager:** Arjay Gallentes  
**Status:** Finalized alongside calibrated evaluation

## Evidence Sources
- Self-Eval PDF (07/16/2025) — object-oriented NACHA refactor; steady metrics
- Stakeholder notes (QA, AUC): S. Duran, M. Marras — collaboration, timely fixes
- Team artifacts: ADO boards, code review notes, unit-testing proposal (in-memory DB)

## Key Judgement Calls
- Rating held at 3.0 for distribution parity vs Sr Dev cohort; pockets of 4-level impact in architecture not yet broad enough to move band.
- Attendance note (one missed standup) acknowledged; not material.

## Risks / Watchouts
- Under-signaling risks can compress testing time.
- Architectural gains need codification to avoid local optimization only.

## Next-Quarter Actions
- Publish NACHA refactor pattern doc + example repo; present in 2 brown-bags.
- Define static-analysis and coverage gates; partner with QA for thresholds.
- Track lead-time and defect-escape deltas post-pattern rollout.

## Follow-ups
- Check adoption rate of refactor pattern by sprint + owner.
- Review risk logs in ADO for proactive signals.

## Recognition
- Public recognition for preventative quality improvements and maintainability uplift.
