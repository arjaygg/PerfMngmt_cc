## ABC Technology — Role OKRs (Y26)

Timeframe: Jan 1–Dec 31, 2026 (Y26)

Alignment inputs: ABC Tech 2025 Strategy, v6 evaluations and calibration themes, AUC project objectives (generalized), and SOW performance metrics (quality, reliability, compliance, delivery predictability). Goals are project-agnostic and applicable across squads.

Measurement sources: ADO (work items, throughput, lead-time), Git/CI (builds, coverage, CFR), SonarQube (quality gates), ServiceNow (incidents/changes), Observability (SLO/SLI dashboards), Confluence (docs), ActivTrak/time hygiene where applicable.

Note on format: OKR = Objective (qualitative) with quantitative Key Results (S.M.A.R.T.).
