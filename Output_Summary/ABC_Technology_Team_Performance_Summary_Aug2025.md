## ABC Technology — Team Performance Summary (Aug 2025)

### Executive Summary
This update summarizes v6 evaluation progress, calibrated outcomes, and trends across ABC Technology as of August 15, 2025. The calibration framework (forced distribution, tenure policy, 9-Box, role parity, bias checks) has been applied to newly completed evaluations.

### Completion Status

### Highlights from Newly Completed Evaluations (sample)
- **Von Andrew Yao (v6.2)**: Updated evaluation reflects Box 6 positioning (High Performance, Medium Potential) with significant calibration adjustment from "Meets Expectations" to "Exceeds Expectations" based on exceptional peer feedback. All three peer reviewers rated performance as "Exceptional" across collaboration, technical skills, and leadership. Role alignment with Software Engineer expectations fully considered, including development plan for technical leadership and strategic thinking enhancement.
- **Raynan Asuncion (v6.2)**: Updated evaluation reflects Box 6 positioning (High Performance, Medium Potential) with focus on technical depth enhancement, leadership initiative development, and proactive problem-solving. Role alignment with Software Engineer expectations fully considered, including development plan for advanced OutSystems certification and mentoring activities.
- **Rex Santos (v6.2)**: Updated evaluation reflects Box 8 positioning (High Performance, High Potential) with focus on communication cadence improvements, mentoring scale-up, and strategic leadership development. Role alignment with AVP, Software Development Manager expectations fully considered.
- Architectural/AI Acceleration: Data modeling and transformation standardized via AI templates and peer-review gates; measurable cycle-time reductions.
- Quality/DevEx Enablement: Expanded unit/integration testing, logging standards, and DevOps playbooks; visibility through dashboards and Confluence playbooks improved onboarding/ramp.
- Reliability & Compliance: Platform patching cadence, ServiceNow usage, and audit hygiene maintained; no material findings reported in period.

### Thematic Strengths
- **Engineering excellence**: testing discipline, refactoring hygiene, risk notes in PRs.
- **AI adoption**: AI-assisted modeling and documentation templates reducing turnaround.
- **Stakeholder visibility**: monthly sprint reports, dashboards, and ceremony continuity uplifted alignment.

### Development Opportunities
- **Communication cadence**: standardized EOD and weekly summaries; earlier risk surfacing.
- **Ownership**: end-to-end mini-initiatives to deepen scope and influence.
- **Knowledge-to-standard**: convert recurring fixes into shared templates/checklists.

### 9-Box Overview (completed subset)
- Predominant clusters: Box 5–8 (solid to high performers). Box 8/9 candidates flagged for scope expansion and succession planning; Box 3–4 stabilized via communication/quality actions.

### Near-Term Actions
- Complete remaining 11 v6 evaluations with calibration controls.
- Publish org-wide PR template addendum (risk/edge-cases; test/coverage snapshot).
- Formalize AI template packs and DevOps playbooks; measure adoption.
- **Immediate Priority:** Address Von Andrew Yao's significant performance-rating gap through recognition and development opportunities.

### Recognition & Retention
- Recognize quality multipliers (testing rigor, platform enablement, onboarding playbooks).
- Monitor critical skill single-points; mitigate with playbooks and mentoring.
