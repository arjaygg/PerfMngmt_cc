- Architectural/AI Acceleration: Data modeling and transformation standardized via AI templates and peer-review gates; measurable cycle-time reductions.
- Quality/DevEx Enablement: Expanded unit/integration testing, logging standards, and DevOps playbooks; visibility through dashboards and Confluence playbooks improved onboarding/ramp.
- Reliability & Compliance: Platform patching cadence, ServiceNow usage, and audit hygiene maintained; no material findings reported in period.

### Thematic Strengths
- **Engineering excellence**: testing discipline, refactoring hygiene, risk notes in PRs.
- **AI adoption**: AI-assisted modeling and documentation templates reducing turnaround.
- **Stakeholder visibility**: monthly sprint reports, dashboards, and ceremony continuity uplifted alignment.

### Development Opportunities
- **Communication cadence**: standardized EOD and weekly summaries; earlier risk surfacing.
- **Ownership**: end-to-end mini-initiatives to deepen scope and influence.
- **Knowledge-to-standard**: convert recurring fixes into shared templates/checklists.

### 9-Box Overview (completed subset)
- Predominant clusters: Box 5–8 (solid to high performers). Box 8/9 candidates flagged for scope expansion and succession planning; Box 3–4 stabilized via communication/quality actions.

### Near-Term Actions
- Complete remaining 10 v6 evaluations with calibration controls.
- Publish org-wide PR template addendum (risk/edge-cases; test/coverage snapshot).
- Formalize AI template packs and DevOps playbooks; measure adoption.
- **Immediate Priority:** Address Von Andrew Yao's significant performance-rating gap through recognition and development opportunities.
- **Development Focus:** Support Paul Eugene Chingtoco's architectural leadership development plan with weekly check-ins and stretch assignments.

### Recognition & Retention
