## ABC Technology — Team Performance Summary (Aug 2025)

### Executive Summary
This update summarizes v6 evaluation progress, calibrated outcomes, and trends across ABC Technology as of August 15, 2025. The calibration framework (forced distribution, tenure policy, 9-Box, role parity, bias checks) has been applied to newly completed evaluations.

### Completion Status
- Total employees: 39
- v6 Completed: 25 (prior: 24; +1 completed in this batch)
- Pending: 14

### Calibration Compliance
- Forced distribution applied at team cohort level (10/70/20 guidance). Current completed subset is trending middle-heavy; remaining pipeline will be governed to meet distribution.
- Tenure policy enforced: <6 months capped at 3.0.
- 9-Box positioning validated; tenure and role parity checks performed.
- Bias reviews conducted (recency/halo/similarity) using multi-source evidence (self, peer/stakeholder, strategy, role).

### Highlights from Newly Completed Evaluations (sample)
- **Rex Santos (v6.1)**: Updated evaluation reflects Box 8 positioning (High Performance, High Potential) with focus on communication cadence improvements and mentoring scale-up
- Architectural/AI Acceleration: Data modeling and transformation standardized via AI templates and peer-review gates; measurable cycle-time reductions.
- Quality/DevEx Enablement: Expanded unit/integration testing, logging standards, and DevOps playbooks; visibility through dashboards and Confluence playbooks improved onboarding/ramp.
- Reliability & Compliance: Platform patching cadence, ServiceNow usage, and audit hygiene maintained; no material findings reported in period.

### Thematic Strengths
- **Engineering excellence**: testing discipline, refactoring hygiene, risk notes in PRs.
- **AI adoption**: AI-assisted modeling and documentation templates reducing turnaround.
- **Stakeholder visibility**: monthly sprint reports, dashboards, and ceremony continuity uplifted alignment.

### Development Opportunities
- **Communication cadence**: standardized EOD and weekly summaries; earlier risk surfacing.
- **Ownership**: end-to-end mini-initiatives to deepen scope and influence.
- **Knowledge-to-standard**: convert recurring fixes into shared templates/checklists.

### 9-Box Overview (completed subset)
- Predominant clusters: Box 5–8 (solid to high performers). Box 8/9 candidates flagged for scope expansion and succession planning; Box 3–4 stabilized via communication/quality actions.

### Near-Term Actions
- Complete remaining 14 v6 evaluations with calibration controls.
- Publish org-wide PR template addendum (risk/edge-cases; test/coverage snapshot).
- Formalize AI template packs and DevOps playbooks; measure adoption.

### Recognition & Retention
- Recognize quality multipliers (testing rigor, platform enablement, onboarding playbooks).
- Monitor critical skill single-points; mitigate with playbooks and mentoring.
