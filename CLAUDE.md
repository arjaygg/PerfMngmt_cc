# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Canonical Spec and Compliance

- `prompt.md` is the authoritative specification for this workspace. If any guidance here conflicts with `prompt.md`, `prompt.md` prevails.
- Do not hallucinate. Use only facts from inputs and existing outputs.
- Preserve existing file formatting and indentation. All outputs must be Markdown.

## Project Overview

This is a performance management analysis workspace for processing employee performance reviews at ABC Technology (Axos Business Center). The system analyzes multiple data sources to generate calibrated performance evaluations, management feedback, and organizational summaries.

## Data Structure

### Input Directories
- `Input_Self-Evaluation/` - PDF performance reviews and impact statements for individual employees
- `Input_Feedback/` - Excel files containing peer feedback and stakeholder reviews
- `Input_9Box/` - Excel files with performance and potential calibration data (9-box grid assessments)
- `Input_Strategy/` - PDF with organizational strategy and OKRs (ABC Tech Strategy & Execution Plan 2025)
- `Input_TeamInfo/` - PDF with team organizational structure and member information
 - `Input_Managers-Assessment/` - Templates and compliance workbooks used to validate guideline and structure adherence
 - `Input_TeamRoles/` - Role descriptions and expectations used for alignment checks
 - `Input_Guidelines/` - Performance review global guidelines and standards

### Output Directories
- `Output_Management-Evaluation/` - Generated manager evaluations and individual feedback
- `Output_Summary/` - Consolidated team performance summaries and leadership evaluations

## Key Requirements

### Performance Review Processing
- Process PDF self-evaluations with structured format including Goals, Competencies, and ratings
- Rating scale: Substantially Exceeds Expectations (SE), Exceeds Expectations (EE), Meets Expectations (M)
- Employees with <6 months tenure are capped at rating 3 (Meet Expectations)
- Apply statistical calibration using forced ranking distribution (top 10%, middle 70%, bottom 20%)

### Document Analysis Tasks
- Extract structured data from PDF performance reviews
- Parse Excel feedback data and 9-box assessments
- Cross-reference against strategic objectives and team information
- Generate comprehensive manager evaluations with evidence-based ratings

### Output Format
- All outputs must be in Markdown format
- Include comprehensive summaries, ratings, and detailed feedback
- Maintain professional, constructive, and actionable language
- Provide clear rationale for ratings and recommendations

## Processing Instructions

When working with this workspace:
1. Use subagents for complex document processing tasks
2. Split longer documents into readable chunks to avoid truncation
3. Ensure all input documents are fully considered in evaluations
4. Apply consistent calibration methods across similar roles and levels
5. Generate both individual assessments and organizational summaries

## Execution Checklist (Must pass for every evaluation)

- Inputs referenced and used: `Input_Self-Evaluation/`, `Input_Feedback/`, `Input_9Box/`, `Input_Strategy/`, `Input_TeamInfo/`, `Input_Managers-Assessment/`, `Input_TeamRoles/`, `Input_Guidelines/`
- Calibration rules applied:
  - Forced distribution 10/70/20
  - Tenure cap: <6 months → max rating 3
  - 9-Box positioning and rationale included
  - Bias detection and role/level consistency checks
- Required sections present in each manager evaluation:
  - Summary of Ratings (manager vs calibrated) with explicit calibration source/date
  - Calibration Reconciliation (why final rating; distribution rationale; actions if gap)
  - Peer Feedback and 360 Evidence (themes + concrete examples)
  - Goals Assessment (ratings with concise evidence per goal)
  - Competencies Evaluation (ratings summary with justification)
  - Strategic Alignment and 9-Box
- Role Alignment (map key observations to expectations in `Input_TeamRoles/`)
  - Bias and Consistency Checks (tenure, role parity, peer vs manager alignment)
  - Development Focus and Specific Actions
  - Recognition/Retention Actions (if performance-rating gap exists)
  - Manager’s Assessment Summary and Review Status
- Outputs written to correct folders; naming: `{Last_First}_{MonthYear}_Manager_Evaluation.md`
- Process in batches of 3–5; group commits per batch with short summary.

## Manager Evaluation Section Template

- Header: Version, Employee, Role, Manager, Period, Date, Confidence
- Summary of Ratings:
  - Manager proposed rating
  - Calibrated rating (cite Final Statistical Calibration Report date)
  - 9-Box position
- Calibration Reconciliation
- Peer Feedback and 360 Evidence (themes + 1–3 examples)
- Goals Assessment (ratings + concise evidence)
- Competencies Evaluation (ratings summary)
- Strategic Alignment and 9-Box
- Bias and Consistency Checks
- Development Focus and Specific Actions
- Recognition/Retention Actions (if applicable)
- Manager’s Assessment Summary
- Review Status: Final (Calibrated = X)

## Batching and Commits

- Process 3–5 employees per batch.
- Group changes per team members.
- Commit and push grouped changes with a concise summary listing employees and key adjustments (e.g., calibration reconciliation, peer feedback integration).

## Quality Standards (from prompt.md)

- Evidence-based assessments with specific examples; balanced feedback; forward-looking recommendations.
- Statistical rigor in calibration; consistency across similar roles/levels.
- Tenure rule: employees with <6 months tenure are capped at rating 3.
- Clear, professional, actionable language.

## File Handling

- PDF files contain structured performance review data with specific sections (Goals, Competencies, Overall ratings)
- Excel files require parsing for feedback data and statistical analysis
- Output files should follow naming conventions that identify the employee and evaluation type

## Memory Updates

- Use subagents when necessary.
- For longer documents, split them first into chunks that can be read correctly. Do not truncate information, and make sure all input documents and files are consider in this overall process.
