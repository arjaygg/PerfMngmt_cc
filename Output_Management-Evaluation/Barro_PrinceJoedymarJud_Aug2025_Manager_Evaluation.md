## Goals Assessment

### 1. Accelerating Banking & Financial Services Mastery & AI Innovation

**Target:** Position ABC Tech as center of excellence in Banking and Financial Services (BFS), and AI-powered innovation, enabling faster development, cost efficiency, and greater ownership of Axos strategic projects and initiatives.

**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Achievement Evidence:**
- Successfully integrated Microsoft Copilot into daily development tasks for code generation and logic suggestions
- Explored AI tools within OutSystems ecosystem to identify workflow enhancement opportunities  
- Demonstrated practical application of AI technologies in real development scenarios
- Contributed to team's AI adoption goals through hands-on experimentation

**Manager Comments:** Prince took genuine initiative in exploring AI tools, which shows curiosity and alignment with our innovation objectives. His integration of Copilot into actual work demonstrates practical thinking rather than just theoretical interest. For a new team member, this level of proactive exploration is commendable and sets a good foundation for future AI leadership opportunities.

### 2. Achieve Engineering Excellence

**Target:** Achieve engineering excellence through faster, high-quality feature delivery, minimizing defects, reducing rework, and strengthening AI/automation-driven development.

**Manager Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)

**Achievement Evidence:**
- Developed reusable components in OutSystems that reduced repetitive development work
- Maintained low defect rates based on QA feedback and post-deployment monitoring
- Actively participated in code reviews, both giving and receiving feedback constructively
- Focused on delivering PBIs within sprint timelines with minimal carry-overs

**Manager Comments:** This is Prince's strongest area. His component development work has had measurable impact on team efficiency, and other developers are already using what he built. The low bug rates reflect attention to detail, and his code review participation shows he's thinking beyond just his own tasks. This exceeds what I typically expect from someone in their first 6 months.

### 3. Empowered & Accountable Teams

**Target:** Build a culture of engagement, accountability, and collaboration, where every team member actively contributes to the success of ABC Strategy.

**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Achievement Evidence:**
