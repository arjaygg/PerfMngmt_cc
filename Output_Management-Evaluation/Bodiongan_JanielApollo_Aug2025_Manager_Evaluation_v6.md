## Summary of Ratings

**Manager Proposed Rating:** 3.0 - Meets Expectations (M)  
**Calibrated Rating:** 3.0 - Meets Expectations (M) [Per Final Statistical Calibration Report - July 31, 2025]  
**Self-Assessment Rating:** 3.46 - Meets Expectations (M)  
**9-Box Position:** Box 5 (Medium Performance, Medium Potential)

## Calibration Reconciliation

**Calibration Rationale:**
Janiel Apollo's calibrated rating of 3.0 appropriately reflects solid technical competency constrained by the 6-month tenure policy (5.3 months). His actual performance quality of 3.4 would warrant higher recognition if not for policy constraints. The calibration positions him appropriately within the middle 70% distribution while acknowledging his strong technical contributions.

**Distribution Consideration:**
- Positioned in middle tier due to tenure constraint
- Technical performance quality exceeds rating allowance
- Future trajectory suggests advancement post 6-month milestone

**Action for Rating Gap:**
The gap between performance quality (3.4) and tenure-constrained rating (3.0) will be addressed through:
- Immediate re-evaluation upon reaching 6-month tenure
- Focus on AI tool adoption and strategic initiative engagement
- Accelerated development support in identified growth areas
