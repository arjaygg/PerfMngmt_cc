His proactive scheduling of alignment meetings, immediate ownership of related issues, and consistent willingness to help teammates shows the kind of leadership thinking we need.

The fact that he consistently asks for more work when finished and actively participates in team prioritization shows he's ready for the next level.

The gap between his self-evaluation (3.3) and his actual performance (3.5) suggests some healthy humility, but I want to ensure he recognizes his true value to the team. His systematic approach to development, combined with genuine care for team success, positions him perfectly for advancement.
