## Overall Performance Summary

**Manager Rating: 4.0 - Exceeds Expectations (EE)**

Working with Rae Jordan over the past year has been genuinely impressive from a collaboration perspective. What consistently stands out to me is her willingness to go beyond her regular hours when urgent tasks arise - I've seen her stay late multiple times to ensure critical APW features get completed on time. Her approach to pair programming sessions has become something other developers specifically request, which tells me she's not just technically capable but also effective at knowledge transfer.

Her self-evaluation rating of 3.69 shows the kind of humility I appreciate, but it understates what I've observed directly. The way Rae Jordan tackles complex problems - systematically breaking them down and then actively collaborating with the right team members - demonstrates exactly the problem-solving maturity we need on the AUC project.

**Overall Manager Rating:** 4.0  
**Performance Level:** Exceeds Expectations - Strong Collaborative Technical Contributor**
