## Calibration Reconciliation

### Calibration Rationale
Rating aligns with peer group for DevOps Engineer with tenure ≥ 6 months. Consistent evidence of strong delivery, knowledge sharing, and growing ownership in Kubernetes/containerization workstreams. Normal distribution constraints validated; no tenure cap applied.

### Distribution & Consistency
- Distribution check: within 10/70/20 targets
- Role parity: aligned with other DevOps Engineers at similar tenure
- Evidence sources: peer feedback (Clearing APIs, health checks), stakeholder comments, delivery outcomes
 - Tenure ceiling: Based on roster assignment timing during the review period, tenure by June 30, 2025 appears ≥ 6 months; ceiling not applied (documented per workflow)

## Peer Feedback and 360 Evidence

### Key Themes from Feedback
1. **Reliability and Responsiveness:** Proactively supports Clearing API health checks and incident remediation; communicates clearly and collaborates effectively across teams.
2. **DevOps Enablement:** Drives dockerization and Kubernetes migration work; lifts burden from developers on CI/CD and container topics; researches root causes and documents findings.
3. **Growth Mindset:** Actively learning CKAD/Kubernetes and DevOps best practices; open to feedback and continuous improvement.

### Specific Examples
- Coordinated daily health checks and responded to Dynatrace alerts, working cross-functionally to remediate issues quickly.
- Led/assisted dockerization and Kubernetes migration for services; provided clear updates and artifacts to developers and product owners.
- Shared new findings and tools during stand-ups, provided links and hands-on walkthroughs; mentored junior peers during onboarding.
- Demonstrated strong collaboration with Clearing team members, showing initiative and ownership on infra-related blockers.

## Competencies Evaluation

### Competency Ratings (Self vs Manager vs Calibrated)
| Competency | Self | Manager | Calibrated |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dependability | EE | EE | EE |
| Problem Solving / Analysis | M | M–High | M–High |
| Productivity | M | M–High | M–High |
| Results Focus | EE | EE | EE |
| Team Leadership | N/A | N/A | N/A |

### Highlights and Manager Comments
**Dependability:** Responds promptly to alerts and requests; follows through to resolution; maintains clear status updates.  
**Problem Solving:** Researches issues thoroughly; identifies root causes in infra and CI/CD; proposes viable, documented fixes.  
**Productivity:** Balances incident response, migration tasks, and documentation; minimizes developer toil.  
**Results Focus:** Improves deployment reliability and developer experience; supports timely sprint delivery.  
**Communication:** Communicates clearly with technical and non-technical stakeholders; fosters trust and alignment.  

Manager Comments: Strong, consistent competency demonstration across reliability, technical execution, and collaboration. Communication and documentation elevate team outcomes.
