## Calibration Reconciliation

### Calibration Rationale
Rating aligns with peer group for DevOps Engineer with tenure ≥ 6 months. Consistent evidence of strong delivery, knowledge sharing, and growing ownership in Kubernetes/containerization workstreams. Normal distribution constraints validated; no tenure cap applied.

### Distribution & Consistency
- Distribution check: within 10/70/20 targets
- Role parity: aligned with other DevOps Engineers at similar tenure
- Evidence sources: peer feedback (Clearing APIs, health checks), stakeholder comments, delivery outcomes

---

## Peer Feedback and 360 Evidence

### Key Themes from Feedback
1. **Reliability and Responsiveness:** Proactively supports Clearing API health checks and incident remediation; communicates clearly and collaborates effectively across teams.
2. **DevOps Enablement:** Drives dockerization and Kubernetes migration work; lifts burden from developers on CI/CD and container topics; researches root causes and documents findings.
3. **Growth Mindset:** Actively learning CKAD/Kubernetes and DevOps best practices; open to feedback and continuous improvement.

### Specific Examples
- Coordinated daily health checks and responded to Dynatrace alerts, working cross-functionally to remediate issues quickly.
- Led/assisted dockerization and Kubernetes migration for services; provided clear updates and artifacts to developers and product owners.
- Shared new findings and tools during stand-ups, provided links and hands-on walkthroughs; mentored junior peers during onboarding.
- Demonstrated strong collaboration with Clearing team members, showing initiative and ownership on infra-related blockers.

## Development Focus and Specific Actions

### Immediate Development Priorities
1. Continue CKAD/Kubernetes upskilling; schedule practice labs weekly
2. Strengthen SRE fundamentals (SLI/SLO/Error Budgets, incident retros)
3. Expand infrastructure-as-code patterns for repeatable environments

### 6-Month Development Plan
- Lead a service’s full Kubernetes cutover (design → rollout → runbook)  
- Facilitate two knowledge-sharing sessions on K8s deployment best practices  
- Partner with QA/PO to formalize incident prevention checks in pipelines

---

## Recognition and Retention Actions

### Immediate Actions
