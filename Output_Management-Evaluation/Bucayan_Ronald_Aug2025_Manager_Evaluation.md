**Manager Comments:** This represents Ronald's strongest performance area. His technical leadership in infrastructure improvements and feature development demonstrates exceptional engineering capability that significantly benefits team productivity and system functionality.

### 3. Empowered & Accountable Teams

**Target:** Build a culture of engagement, accountability, and collaboration.

**Manager Rating:** Needs Development (ND)

**Achievement Evidence:**
- **Goal Achievement**: 0% completion against 50% target for team member ownership of strategic initiatives
- **Team Engagement Gap**: Limited evidence of fostering team-wide accountability culture
- **Individual Focus**: Strong personal accountability without corresponding team empowerment initiatives
- **Missed Opportunities**: Potential to leverage recruitment and process improvement successes for broader team development

**Manager Comments:** While Ronald demonstrates strong personal accountability, translating this into team-wide empowerment represents a significant growth opportunity requiring focused attention.

**Goals Summary Rating:** 2.67 (Needs Development)**
