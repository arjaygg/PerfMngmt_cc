## Calibration Reconciliation

### Calibration Rationale
Exceeds Expectations is validated by multi-source evidence:
- Peer feedback highlights technical excellence, reliability under pressure, and approachability (e.g., “technically sharp and very dependable under pressure”).
- Strong collaboration and knowledge sharing across API discussions; sets examples for junior engineers and maintains clean design and refactoring hygiene.
- Measurable engineering outcomes from self-evaluation: unit test coverage targets met for service and repository layers; quality gates integrated via CI pipelines.
- Tenure: ~7.0 months as of June 30, 2025 (hire date: 12/02/2024) — no ceiling constraints; performance-based rating applies.

### Distribution Compliance
- Consistent with Sr Software Engineer peer cohort positioning (High Performance, Medium Potential).
- Aligns with cohort distribution; no calibration downshift required.

### Performance-Rating Gap Actions
None required — self and manager ratings are aligned.
