## Goals Assessment

### Achieve Engineering Excellence
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meet Expectations (M) - Tenure Constrained  
**Achievement Level:** 25%

**Manager Comments:**
What I've seen from Diego in these first two months has genuinely impressed me. While other new hires typically focus on just getting their assigned tasks done, Diego approaches his work differently - he actively looks for ways to improve our processes. I've watched him dive into our data modeling workflows and come back with thoughtful suggestions for enhancements. His adoption of Cursor has been particularly noteworthy; I've observed him using it not just as a development tool, but strategically to accelerate his learning curve on our transformation work. The 25% achievement level here is purely a function of his short time with us - the quality and approach I'm seeing suggests much higher potential once he has more runway to execute.

### Advancing Banking & Financial Services Excellence & AI Innovation Excellence
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meet Expectations (M) - Tenure Constrained  
**Achievement Level:** 50%

**Manager Comments:**
Diego's approach to mastering our banking domain has been methodical and impressive. Rather than just asking surface-level questions, I've noticed him systematically working through our documentation and using AI tools to really understand complex banking terminology and processes. What his colleagues have picked up on - and I've seen firsthand - is how he doesn't just learn for himself. One team member specifically told me Diego "rapidly masters new technologies and teaches others," which aligns with what I observe in our team meetings. The fact that he's hit every delivery deadline in just over two months, while still coming up to speed on our systems, tells me he's genuinely committed to excellence. His 50% achievement level reflects solid progress given his tenure, and I expect this to accelerate significantly.

### Collaborative & Empowered Team Culture
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meet Expectations (M) - Tenure Constrained  
**Achievement Level:** 50%

**Manager Comments:**
What I've appreciated most about Diego is how naturally he's found the right balance between independence and collaboration. From day one, he's taken complete ownership of his data modeling work - I rarely need to check in on his progress because he proactively updates me on status and flags any potential roadblocks. But he's also not operating in a silo. Multiple colleagues have mentioned to me how Diego "goes above and beyond in collaboration" and "proactively mentors multiple colleagues." Just last week, I discovered he'd helped another team member with hierarchical structure tasks that weren't even on his plate. That kind of initiative tells me he truly understands what team empowerment means - it's not just about owning your work, it's about lifting the whole team's capabilities.

## Competencies Assessment

### Dependability
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meet Expectations (M) - Tenure Constrained

**Manager Comments:**
Dependability isn't always easy to assess with new hires, but Diego has made it clear from the start. When I gave him those challenging database cleanup tasks for our demo preparation - tasks that had tight deadlines and significant visibility - he didn't just take them on, he owned them completely. What sets him apart is his communication approach. Instead of struggling silently and creating bottlenecks, he proactively flags issues and asks for help when needed. One colleague specifically mentioned to me how Diego "always updates the documentation and ensures everyone on our team is notified" - that attention to keeping everyone informed has really built trust across the team. His systematic approach to ERD creation, combined with this transparent communication style, makes him someone I can confidently delegate to and know the work will get done right.

### Problem Solving/Analysis
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meet Expectations (M) - Tenure Constrained

**Manager Comments:**
Diego's problem-solving approach has been one of the most impressive aspects of his performance. When we encountered those inconsistent data types and undefined relationships in our ALF modernization work - challenges that had been stumping the team for weeks - I watched Diego tackle them methodically. Rather than getting overwhelmed, he systematically analyzed patterns across both Accuterm and Database systems to understand the underlying structure. His colleagues have picked up on this analytical strength too; one team member told me how Diego "consistently generates innovative solutions and strategic ideas." What I find particularly valuable is how he breaks down complex problems into manageable pieces and then leverages tools like Cursor to accelerate his analysis. For someone still learning our systems, his pattern recognition skills and ability to define logical entity relationships shows real analytical maturity.

### Productivity
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meet Expectations (M) - Tenure Constrained

**Manager Comments:**
Diego's productivity has been consistently strong, and what I appreciate most is how thoughtfully he approaches task management. I've watched him assess work not just by urgency, but by complexity too, which helps him maintain momentum on the deliverables that matter most. His communication style with me has been particularly effective - those emoji status updates might seem small, but they've really streamlined our asynchronous communication and help me stay informed without micromanaging. His colleagues have consistently praised his deadline reliability, with one specifically telling me Diego "consistently exceeds expectations" in meeting commitments. In the two-plus months we've worked together, he hasn't missed a single deadline - which is genuinely remarkable for someone still learning our systems, processes, and team dynamics.

### Results Focus
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meet Expectations (M) - Tenure Constrained

**Manager Comments:**
Diego's results focus really showed itself during our recent demo preparation crunch. When I assigned him that database cleanup task - one of those high-visibility, tight-deadline assignments that can make or break a demo - he didn't just take it on, he completely owned it. What impressed me most was watching him balance this urgent request with his other ongoing work. He maintained his communication cadence with both QA and Product teams while executing the cleanup, never dropping the ball on his other responsibilities. The thoroughness of his entity relationship analysis and his work defining both logical and physical links told me he genuinely understands that quality and speed aren't mutually exclusive. That level of accountability and results delivery under pressure shows me he's committed not just to his own success, but to the team's success as well.

## Overall Assessment

Working with Diego over these past two months has been genuinely impressive from a management perspective. His technical capability, collaborative mindset, and professional maturity stand out - especially considering he's still in his first quarter with us. What strikes me most is how naturally he's integrated into our team dynamics while taking on complex responsibilities that usually take new hires significantly longer to master.

Across every area I've evaluated, Diego's actual performance quality exceeds expectations. His systematic problem-solving approach, proactive communication habits, and willingness to contribute beyond his immediate responsibilities show exceptional capability for someone at his tenure level. The consistent peer feedback I'm receiving reinforces my direct observations - colleagues specifically describe him as someone who "goes above and beyond" and "demonstrates leadership potential."

I need to be completely clear about something: the 3.0 rating Diego is receiving has nothing to do with his actual performance quality. The organizational policy caps ratings for employees under 6 months, period. Based on what I've observed - his innovative process improvements, complex technical problem-solving, and successful delivery under pressure - Diego would normally receive significantly higher formal recognition. He's demonstrated both the professional maturity and technical skills that position him for rapid advancement the moment tenure constraints are lifted.

**Final Rating: 3.0/5.0 (Meet Expectations - Tenure Policy Constraint Only)**  
***Performance Quality Level: Substantially Exceeds Expectations (4.2/5.0)***

## Manager Recommendation

**I'm strongly recommending Diego for our accelerated development track and expanded technical leadership responsibilities the moment his tenure allows it. What I've witnessed in just over two months tells me he's ready for senior data architecture responsibilities now - not in six months or a year. His unique combination of technical capability, collaborative leadership, and proactive problem-solving approach makes him exactly the kind of talent we need to retain and grow. Diego has already proven himself a valuable asset to both our team and the broader organization.**
