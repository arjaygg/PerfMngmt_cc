# Manager Evaluation v6 — Santos, Rex Nino

- Employee: Rex Nino Santos (Sr. Software Engineer)
- Manager: Arjay Gallentes
- Period: Jan 1 – Jun 30, 2025
- Version: v6 (Calibrated)
- Date: Aug 13, 2025
- Confidence: Medium-High

## Summary of Ratings
- Manager proposed rating: 4.0 — Exceeds Expectations (EE)
- Calibrated rating (Final Statistical Calibration Report — Jul 31, 2025): 4.0 — Exceeds Expectations (EE)
- 9-Box position: 6 — Stretch/Develop (Moderate Potential, High Performance)

## Calibration Reconciliation
Self-evidence and peer feedback indicate elevated performance across collaboration, engineering rigor, and team enablement. Forced-distribution capacity available for high-performers; rating calibrated at 4.0.

## Peer Feedback and 360 Evidence (themes + examples)
- Technical and delivery leadership: drives quality (TDD/unit/integration), logging standards, and team metrics.
- Engagement and visibility: stakeholder alignment; individual coaching; knowledge sharing culture.
- Impact orientation: dashboards, Power BI, and ADO views to improve throughput and clarity.

Examples:
- Instituted testing discipline and logging guidance improving debug accuracy.
- Produced recurring sprint reports and dashboards raising execution transparency.

## Goals Assessment
1) Achieve Engineering Excellence
- Self: M; Manager: EE
- Evidence: increased automated testing; improved observability/logging; raised bar on DoD.
- Manager comments: Clear positive effect on rework reduction and debugging speed. Suggestion: codify a short engineering handbook section for the team.

2) Empowered & Accountable Teams
- Self: EE; Manager: EE
- Evidence: cascaded expectations, 1:1s, and knowledge sharing; consistent team communication.
- Manager comments: Effective influence without formal authority. Suggestion: delegate facilitation to emerging leads periodically to scale impact.

3) Stakeholder Engagement & Visibility
- Self: EE; Manager: EE
- Evidence: sprint/monthly reporting, Power BI metrics, cross-team dashboards.
- Manager comments: Strong enablement of decisions through data. Suggestion: add outcome measures (lead time, change failure) to reinforce cause-effect.

## Competencies Evaluation
- Dependability: SE — accountable for team outcomes; aligns to standards reliably.
- Problem Solving/Analysis: EE — addresses systemic issues; improves team practices.
- Productivity: EE — leverages automation and standards to increase velocity.
- Results Focus: M/EE — maintains alignment to goals; strengthens DoD adherence.
- Team Leadership: EE — mentors and guides peers; emerging leadership pipeline.

## Strategic Alignment and 9-Box
Work advances Engineering Excellence, predictability, and quality. 9-Box: 6 — Stretch/Develop; focus on scaling influence and coaching depth.

## Bias and Consistency Checks
Tenure > 12 months; parity check with other high contributors; multi-source corroboration.

## Development Focus and Specific Actions
- Publish a concise engineering standards playbook (tests, logging, review checklist).
- Coach two peers on metrics use and test-first thinking; rotate facilitation.
- Add 2 outcome metrics to dashboards and review monthly.

## Recognition/Retention Actions
Nominate for engineering recognition; provide stretch scope on standards rollout; consider leadership track preparation.

## Manager’s Assessment Summary
High-impact contributor elevating team practices and execution visibility. Next step is scaling influence through codified standards and structured coaching.

## Review Status
Final — Calibrated = 4.0 (Exceeds Expectations)
