## Summary of Ratings
- **Manager Proposed Rating:** 3.2 – Meets Expectations  
- **Calibrated Rating:** 3.0 – Meets Expectations (Final Statistical Calibration Report – July 31, 2025)  
- **9-Box Position:** Solid Performance / Solid-to-Growth Potential (emerging leadership via pod lead)

## Calibration Reconciliation
- Forced distribution applied (10/70/20). Placement in middle 70% aligns with data engineer cohort given tenure ~12 months and strong but scoped impact.  
- Tenure ≈ 12 months; tenure cap does not apply.  
- Self-evaluation 3.0 aligns with calibrated 3.0; consistent with peer parity.

## Peer Feedback and 360 Evidence (themes + examples)
- Delivery under pressure: “Handled multiple late-cycle refinements without quality compromise.” — Product/OS partners  
- Documentation and enablement: “Guides and manuals improved team independence.” — Data team  
- Collaboration: “Visible, responsive updates; coordinates blockers effectively.” — Cross-functional stakeholders

## Goals Assessment

### Accelerating BFS Mastery & AI Innovation
- **Self-Rating:** M  
- **Manager Rating:** M  
- **Achievement Evidence:** Installed and applied Copilot/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf; AI-assisted SQL and documentation for legacy models; automated scripts for physical/dimension tables.  
- **Manager Comments:** Practical AI enablement for data engineering. Expand templates and share exemplars to scale adoption.

### Empowered & Accountable Teams
- **Self-Rating:** M  
- **Manager Rating:** M  
- **Achievement Evidence:** Cross-functional collaboration (AUC, OS, Product); centralized documentation (Data Manual Deployment, Source Column Guide, ERD guide, Data Modeling Guide); consistent progress reporting.

## Strategic Alignment and 9-Box
- Alignment to ABC 2025: data enablement, documentation, and cross-team support reinforce Engineering Excellence and Empowered Teams.  
- 9-Box: Solid Performance / Solid-to-Growth Potential with path to higher potential through analytics expansion and mentoring.

## Bias and Consistency Checks
- Tenure: ~12 months; no cap.  
- Role parity: matches data engineer cohort at 3.0.  
- Self vs manager: self 3.0; calibrated 3.0 — aligned.

## Development Focus and Specific Actions
- Python and analysis: complete foundational coursework and apply to data storytelling dashboards.  
- Mentoring: formalize onboarding plan for data modeling pod; track adoption of guides.  
- Automation: extend AI-generated scripts with validation checks and templates.  
- Stakeholder alignment: participate earlier in feature research to influence data design upstream.

## Recognition / Retention Actions
- Recognition: call-out for knowledge systems and late-cycle delivery reliability in data team forum.

## Manager’s Assessment Summary
Nenissa meets expectations with notable strengths in documentation, enablement, and delivery under pressure. Building analytics capability and mentoring structure will elevate scope and impact.
