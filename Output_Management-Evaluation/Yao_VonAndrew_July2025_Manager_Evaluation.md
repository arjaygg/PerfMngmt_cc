# Manager Performance Evaluation
## Von Andrew Yao - Developer
**Review Period:** January 1, 2025 - June 30, 2025  
**Manager:** Arjay Gallentes  
**Employee Tenure:** 21 months (Hired: October 1, 2023)  
**Project Assignment:** Zenith Legacy Platform

## Executive Summary

I've been working with Von Andrew for almost two years now, and what I can consistently count on is reliability. When I assign tasks related to Zenith Legacy, they get done. He keeps the system stable, avoids production bugs, and maintains steady progress on his deliverables. That foundation of dependability is valuable, especially on legacy systems where stability matters.

However, I need to be direct about where I see opportunities for Von Andrew's growth. While his execution is solid, I'm not seeing the proactive engagement and innovation that would take him to the next level. There's a gap between steady delivery and the kind of strategic thinking and continuous improvement mindset that our organization increasingly needs.

**Overall Performance Rating: 3.1/5.0 (Meets Expectations)**

## Goals Assessment

### Execute on Zenith Legacy Roadmap
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Achievement Level:** 75%

**Manager Comments:**
Von Andrew's approach to the Zenith Legacy roadmap is exactly what I'd expect - steady, methodical execution. He hits the 75% achievement mark by completing what's assigned to him. But here's where I'd like to see growth: I want him to engage more proactively with the planning process itself. Instead of just executing the roadmap, I'd love to see him contribute ideas for how we might improve it or identify opportunities we're missing.

### Execute on Zenith Product Roadmap
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Achievement Level:** 50%

**Manager Comments:**
This is where I need to have a candid conversation with Von Andrew about self-assessment accuracy. He rated himself "Exceeds Expectations" but achieved 50% against the target. I appreciate his commitment to the work, but exceeding expectations means delivering beyond what's expected, not just being committed to it. The steady execution is good, but I need to see innovation and additional value that justifies the higher rating he's giving himself.

### Financial Management
**Employee Self-Rating:** Mixed (M/EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Achievement Level:** 75%

**Manager Comments:**
Von Andrew demonstrates good budget consciousness, noting "We are way lower than the budget and we don't have any unplanned expenses." This shows responsible financial awareness, though engagement with broader financial management concepts could be enhanced.

### Banking Services Availability and Reliability
**Employee Self-Rating:** Mixed (M/EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Achievement Level:** 70%

**Manager Comments:**
Von Andrew's focus on avoiding production bugs and maintaining system stability is commendable. His comment "We don't have production bugs and no high production issues" demonstrates attention to quality. However, more proactive engagement in service improvement initiatives would strengthen performance in this area.

### Modernization of Zenith Platform
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Achievement Level:** 75%

**Manager Comments:**
Von Andrew maintains steady progress on platform modernization efforts. His consistent approach to assigned tasks contributes to overall project momentum, though more initiative in identifying modernization opportunities would be beneficial.

## Competencies Assessment

### Dependability
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)

**Manager Comments:**
Von Andrew's commitment to reliability is genuinely strong. His statement "Always been my commitment" reflects authentic dedication to meeting obligations. He consistently attends meetings, meets deadlines, and maintains steady work quality. This is one of his strongest competencies.

### Problem Solving/Analysis
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

While Von Andrew states "Every decisions I made was made on facts and numbers to be more accurate," his problem-solving approach tends to be straightforward rather than analytical. He solves assigned problems effectively but shows limited initiative in identifying underlying issues or proposing systemic improvements.

### Productivity

**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Manager Comments:**
Von Andrew maintains consistent productivity levels and shares information with the team as needed. His focus on completing PBIs ("Always trying to finish my PBI before the deadline") demonstrates good task management. However, opportunities exist for enhancing productivity through process improvements and knowledge sharing initiatives.

### Results Focus
**Employee Self-Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Manager Comments:**
Von Andrew shows strong commitment to task completion and deadline adherence. His metric-focused approach ("The more we solve, the better") demonstrates results orientation. However, focus tends to be on quantity of tasks rather than strategic impact or quality improvements.

## Overall Assessment

In my nearly two years of working with Von Andrew, I've come to appreciate his steady reliability - he's the kind of developer you can assign legacy maintenance tasks to and know they'll get done correctly and on time. His dedication to avoiding production bugs and maintaining system stability has real value, especially on critical legacy systems like Zenith.

But I also need to be honest about what I'm not seeing from Von Andrew: the initiative and growth mindset that would take him beyond his current role. When I look at his self-evaluations, there's a disconnect between his perception of his performance and what I observe. His interest in AI integration is promising, but I need to see him actively pursue that growth, not just express interest in it.

Von Andrew is at a crossroads in his career with us. The foundation is solid, but he needs to decide whether he wants to continue as a steady maintainer or develop into someone who contributes to our strategic direction. I'm willing to support either path, but the choice and initiative need to come from him.

**Final Rating: 3.1/5.0 (Meets Expectations)**
