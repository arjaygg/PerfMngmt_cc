## Manager's Assessment Summary
Rex Santos demonstrates strong technical capabilities and team collaboration skills, with particular strengths in quality advocacy and mentoring. His contributions to engineering standards and team enablement are valuable assets to the organization. However, there are significant rating discrepancies across four competencies (Dependability, Problem Solving/Analysis, Productivity, and Team Leadership) that require immediate attention and structured development plans.

The critical rule has been applied to all four competency discrepancies, with comprehensive development plans that include specific milestones, timeline expectations, and support resources. While communication cadence improvements are needed to address stakeholder feedback, the primary focus must be on bridging the competency gaps through structured improvement initiatives.

The next phase of his development should focus on scaling his influence through codified standards, structured coaching programs, and achieving the higher competency ratings he believes he deserves. This will require active monitoring, weekly check-ins, and 90-day development timelines to maximize his organizational impact and align expectations.
