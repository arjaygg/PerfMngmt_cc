## Overall Performance Summary

**Calibrated Rating: 3 - Meets Expectations (M)**

Working with Ronald this past six months has been both rewarding and eye-opening. Here's someone who has led successful workshops, transformed our recruitment process, and consistently delivered technical solutions - yet rated himself as "Needs Development" at 2.83. This disconnect concerns me because it suggests Ronald doesn't recognize his own value and contributions.

I've watched him facilitate OutSystems workshops that genuinely improved our team's capabilities. I've seen him take ownership of recruitment process improvements that cut onboarding time in half. These aren't small accomplishments - they're leadership behaviors that demonstrate real impact. The fact that his peer feedback and 9-box rating align with my assessment (4.0) confirms what I see daily: Ronald has more talent and leadership potential than he gives himself credit for.

**Overall Manager Rating:** 3.4  
**Calibrated Performance Band:** Middle 70% (Rating 3 - M) - Leadership Development Focus**

## Goals Assessment

### 1. Accelerating Banking & Financial Services Mastery & AI Innovation

**Target:** Position ABC Tech as center of excellence in BFS and AI-powered innovation, enabling faster development, cost efficiency, and greater ownership of Axos strategic projects.

**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)**

**Achievement Analysis:**
- **Self-Assessment Gap:** Employee rated this as "In Progress" with 0% completion, not reflecting actual contributions
- **Actual Performance:** Demonstrated BFS alignment through OutSystems expertise and project delivery
- **Development Opportunity:** Limited visible engagement with AI innovation initiatives
- **Technical Foundation:** Strong OutSystems platform knowledge supporting BFS objectives

**Manager Comments:** This is where I need to help Ronald see what I see. His self-assessment of 0% completion doesn't match reality - his OutSystems expertise directly supports our BFS objectives. I think he's so focused on what he hasn't done that he's missing what he has accomplished. We need to work together to identify specific ways he can engage with AI initiatives, but more importantly, I need to help him recognize the strategic value he's already delivering.

**Manager Comments:** This is where Ronald truly shines, and I wish he could see it the way I do. He doesn't just follow team principles - he actively strengthens them. When he implemented dev pairing and peer review processes, that wasn't just compliance - that was leadership. He proactively gathered team feedback to ensure our RTO policy worked for everyone. That level of thoughtfulness and initiative is exactly what I look for in a future leader.

## Manager's Overall Assessment

Ronald Bucayan is one of those employees who consistently surprises me - not with what he accomplishes, but with how little credit he gives himself for those accomplishments. His self-rating of 2.83 "Needs Development" is so far off from reality that it's become my top priority to help him see what everyone else sees.

I've watched Ronald lead workshops that transformed how our teams understand OutSystems. I've seen him take a broken recruitment process and systematically fix it, cutting onboarding time in half. I've observed him facilitate cross-team collaboration with natural ease. These aren't the behaviors of someone who "needs development" - these are the behaviors of someone ready for expanded leadership responsibilities.

His 9-box rating of 4.0 and strong peer feedback confirm what I see daily. Five different colleagues highlighted his leadership potential in their reviews. Yet somehow, he can't see it himself. This gap between perception and reality is what keeps me focused on his development.

**MY KEY PRIORITIES FOR RONALD:**
- Help him accurately recognize his achievements and leadership contributions
- Leverage his natural leadership abilities through formal development opportunities  
- Address communication concerns while building on his proven facilitation skills
- Provide regular, specific recognition to build realistic self-assessment

**THE BOTTOM LINE:** Ronald has leadership potential that our organization needs. My job is to help him see it, believe it, and act on it with confidence.

**My Recommendation:** Immediate focus on leadership development and regular recognition to align his self-perception with his actual contributions.
