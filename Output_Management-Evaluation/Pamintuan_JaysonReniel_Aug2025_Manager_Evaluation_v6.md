## Calibration Reconciliation

### Calibration Rationale
Jayson's rating of 3.0 is constrained by tenure policy:
- ~5.8-month tenure as of June 30, 2025 (joined January 6, 2025) keeps maximum rating at 3.0 per <6 months policy
- Solid performance within onboarding period expectations
- Mixed peer feedback indicating development potential
- Appropriate rating for learning phase

### Distribution Compliance
- Aligns with bottom 20% segment due to tenure constraints
- Consistent with other new hires (<6 months)
- No performance issues, rating purely tenure-based

### Performance-Rating Gap Actions
None required - performance aligns with onboarding expectations.
