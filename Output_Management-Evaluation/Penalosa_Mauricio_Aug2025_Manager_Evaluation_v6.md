Evidence since mid-cycle supports sustained delivery and positive competency trajectory; final rating calibrated to 3.0 to reflect net performance and consistency with role peers. Distribution check passes (10/70/20).

## Peer Feedback and 360 Evidence (themes + examples)
- Reliability and initiative: delivers with minimal supervision; takes ownership of outcomes.
- Process and quality: seeks structure; contributes to timely, quality handoffs.
- Collaboration: constructive partner to team; communicates progress and blockers.

Examples:
- Modernization/operations work delivered on time with strong ownership of handoffs.
- Coordinated effectively with stakeholders to keep work moving despite ambiguity.

## Goals Assessment
1) Execute on Zenith Product/Legacy Roadmap
- Self: mix of EE/ND; Manager: M
- Achievement evidence:
  - Delivered key roadmap items; demonstrated initiative in organizing work; closed gaps with training.
- Manager comments: Delivery trajectory is improving; continue prioritizing tangible outcomes over process exploration. Suggestion: maintain weekly objective ledger linking tasks to roadmap KRs.

2) Operations — Productivity/Quality
- Self: EE; Manager: M
- Achievement evidence:
  - On-time delivery with fewer clarifications; improved traceability of changes.
- Manager comments: Positive trend on productivity and quality signals. Suggestion: expand unit tests and definition-of-done checks before handoff.

3) Compliance and Risk Mitigation
- Self: ND; Manager: M
- Achievement evidence:
  - No material findings; followed security/audit instructions; raised risks timely.
- Manager comments: Baseline maintained; continue proactive documentation of mitigations.

## Competencies Evaluation
- Dependability: EE — meets commitments; calm under pressure; accountable.
- Problem Solving/Analysis: M — fact-based, decomposes issues; seeks SME input.
- Productivity: EE — structures workload; shares knowledge; seeks growth.
- Results Focus: EE — outcome-oriented; closes loops; improves traceability.
- Team Leadership: N/A — not in formal lead role; demonstrates ownership behaviors.

## Strategic Alignment and 9-Box
Delivery supports stability of Zenith modernization and operations. 9-Box: 5 — Develop; focus on consistent outcomes and reducing variance.

## Bias and Consistency Checks
Tenure > 6 months; cap not applicable. Role parity validated against developers with similar scope; evidence triangulated across sources.

## Development Focus and Specific Actions
- Tighten outcome discipline: weekly objective ledger aligned to roadmap KRs.
- Strengthen preventive quality: add unit/integration tests and peer review checklist.
- Communication cadence: concise status updates with risk/impact next steps.

## Recognition/Retention Actions
Acknowledge improved consistency and ownership in sprint review; assign a small modernization sub-epic with clear metrics.

## Manager’s Assessment Summary
Trajectory is upward with stronger structure and ownership. Focus on consistent, measurable outcomes and pre-handoff quality to solidify performance at Meets.

## Review Status
Final — Calibrated = 3.0 (Meets Expectations)
