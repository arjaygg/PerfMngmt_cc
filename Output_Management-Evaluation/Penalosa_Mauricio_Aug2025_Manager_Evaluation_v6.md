## Manager Evaluation v6 — Mauricio Penalosa (Developer)

### Summary of Ratings
- **Self Overall**: 2.99 (Needs Development)
- **Manager Overall (pre-calibration)**: 3.0 (Meets)
- **Calibrated Final Rating**: 3.0 (Meets)
- **Calibration Date**: 2025-08-12

### Calibration Reconciliation
- Mixed self-ratings (several ND despite positive narratives). Cross-source feedback indicates responsible and supportive behavior with status reporting gaps.
- Forced distribution sustained in middle cohort. Tenure > 6 months → not tenure-capped.
- 9-Box: Performance 3.0, Potential 2.2 → Box 4 (Core Contributor; stabilize performance).

### 360 Feedback Themes
- Strengths: takes ownership, stretches for deadlines, reliable support.
- Opportunities: proactive communication (status cadence), clarity in updates, earlier escalation.

### Goals Assessment (selected)
1) Zenith Legacy/Modernization & Roadmap
   - **Self**: ND (for multiple roadmap items)
   - **Manager**: Meets (3.0)
   - Evidence: Delivered portions of modernization and quality gates; narratives reflect effort but lack quantifiable outcomes.
   - Manager Comments: Solid intent and work ethic. Next: convert intention into measurable delivery; baseline and track throughput and quality per sprint.

2) Operations—Productivity & Quality
   - **Self**: EE (multiple)
   - **Manager**: Meets (3.0)
   - Evidence: Claims of high ownership; corroborated by some peers on reliability, but communication latency noted by stakeholders.
   - Manager Comments: Improve signal-to-noise in updates; share blockers early. Next: adopt end-of-day status and weekly summary.

3) Compliance/Risk
   - **Self**: ND
   - **Manager**: Meets (3.0)
   - Evidence: No major adverse events; limited documented preventative actions.
   - Manager Comments: Add routine compliance checks into workflow; document remediation when applicable.

### Competencies
- Dependability — **Self**: EE | **Manager**: M
- Problem Solving — **Self**: M | **Manager**: M
- Productivity — **Self**: EE | **Manager**: M
- Results Focus — **Self**: EE | **Manager**: M

Manager Comments (Competencies): Good intent and perseverance. Convert to outcomes by scoping, estimating, and sharing progress visibly. Next: use SMART tasking and mid-sprint demos.

### Strategic Alignment
- Contributes to modernization stream. To better align with Engineering Excellence, adopt unit test baselines and PR templates with metrics.

### Development Focus and Actions
- Communication: daily EOD post + Monday plan; use concise template (Done/Doing/Risks/Help).
- Planning: break work into ≤2-day chunks with acceptance criteria.
- Quality: add basic unit tests; run lint/coverage; share results in PR.

### Recognition/Retention
- Recognition not advised yet; focus on stabilization over 2 sprints; reassess.

### Manager’s Assessment Summary
Meeting baseline expectations with opportunities in communication, planning, and measurable outcomes. With structure and cadence, performance can rise to strong meets.

- 9-Box position: 5 — Develop (Moderate Potential, Meets Performance)

## Calibration Reconciliation
Self-evaluation overall reflects borderline output (goals section trended ND with competencies trending M/EE). Evidence since mid-cycle supports sustained delivery and positive competency trajectory; final rating calibrated to 3.0 to reflect net performance and consistency with role peers. Distribution check passes (10/70/20).

## Peer Feedback and 360 Evidence (themes + examples)
- Reliability and initiative: delivers with minimal supervision; takes ownership of outcomes.
- Process and quality: seeks structure; contributes to timely, quality handoffs.
- Collaboration: constructive partner to team; communicates progress and blockers.

Examples:
- Modernization/operations work delivered on time with strong ownership of handoffs.
- Coordinated effectively with stakeholders to keep work moving despite ambiguity.

## Goals Assessment
1) Execute on Zenith Product/Legacy Roadmap
- Self: mix of EE/ND; Manager: M
- Achievement evidence:
  - Delivered key roadmap items; demonstrated initiative in organizing work; closed gaps with training.
- Manager comments: Delivery trajectory is improving; continue prioritizing tangible outcomes over process exploration. Suggestion: maintain weekly objective ledger linking tasks to roadmap KRs.

2) Operations — Productivity/Quality
- Self: EE; Manager: M
- Achievement evidence:
  - On-time delivery with fewer clarifications; improved traceability of changes.
- Manager comments: Positive trend on productivity and quality signals. Suggestion: expand unit tests and definition-of-done checks before handoff.

3) Compliance and Risk Mitigation
- Self: ND; Manager: M
- Achievement evidence:
  - No material findings; followed security/audit instructions; raised risks timely.
- Manager comments: Baseline maintained; continue proactive documentation of mitigations.

## Competencies Evaluation
- Dependability: EE — meets commitments; calm under pressure; accountable.
- Problem Solving/Analysis: M — fact-based, decomposes issues; seeks SME input.
- Productivity: EE — structures workload; shares knowledge; seeks growth.
- Results Focus: EE — outcome-oriented; closes loops; improves traceability.
- Team Leadership: N/A — not in formal lead role; demonstrates ownership behaviors.

## Strategic Alignment and 9-Box
Delivery supports stability of Zenith modernization and operations. 9-Box: 5 — Develop; focus on consistent outcomes and reducing variance.

## Bias and Consistency Checks
Tenure > 6 months; cap not applicable. Role parity validated against developers with similar scope; evidence triangulated across sources.

## Development Focus and Specific Actions
- Tighten outcome discipline: weekly objective ledger aligned to roadmap KRs.
- Strengthen preventive quality: add unit/integration tests and peer review checklist.
- Communication cadence: concise status updates with risk/impact next steps.

## Recognition/Retention Actions
Acknowledge improved consistency and ownership in sprint review; assign a small modernization sub-epic with clear metrics.

## Manager’s Assessment Summary
Trajectory is upward with stronger structure and ownership. Focus on consistent, measurable outcomes and pre-handoff quality to solidify performance at Meets.

## Review Status
Final — Calibrated = 3.0 (Meets Expectations)
