## Executive Summary

What stands out about Christopher in his nearly 11 months with us is his instinct for spotting the gaps nobody else sees. While other developers focus on getting their code working, Christopher notices when we're missing the documentation that would help the next person. That kind of systems thinking is exactly what we need more of on the team.

## Goals Assessment

### Achieve Engineering Excellence
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Achievement Level:** 100%

**Manager Comments:**
What I appreciate about Christopher's work is that he doesn't just complete his tasks - he makes sure the next person can understand and build on what he's done. When he created those detailed guides for table and XREF file creation, he wasn't asked to do that. He saw a knowledge gap that was slowing everyone down and took the initiative to fix it. That's the kind of proactive thinking that makes a real difference.

### Empowered & Accountable Teams
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Achievement Level:** 100%

**Manager Comments:**
Christopher stepped up during Sprint 1 when things could have gone sideways. Instead of waiting for someone else to organize the review and planning, he pulled the team together and kept us on track. That kind of initiative - seeing what needs to happen and making it happen - is exactly what I look for in a senior developer.

### Recruitment & Talent Excellence
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Achievement Level:** 100%

**Manager Comments:**
Christopher's work on recruitment and onboarding has been incredibly practical. He's participated in six technical interviews and created documentation that actually helps new team members get up to speed faster. More importantly, his onboarding resources mean our senior developers can focus on development instead of answering the same setup questions over and over.

## Competencies Assessment

### Dependability
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Manager Comments:**
I can rely on Christopher to figure things out. When he took on the Document Delivery Methods screen, he didn't need me looking over his shoulder every step of the way - he worked through the challenges, coordinated with the right people across different time zones, and delivered a working solution. That level of independence makes my job easier.

### Problem Solving/Analysis
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Manager Comments:**
Christopher approaches problems methodically. He doesn't just implement what's written in the PBI - he digs deeper, asks the right questions of SMEs and Product Owners, and makes sure he understands the real requirements. The fact that he adds displays and checks functionality before handing off to QA shows he's thinking about the whole workflow, not just his piece of it.

### Productivity
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)

**Manager Comments:**
Christopher doesn't just finish his tasks and move on - he documents what he learned along the way. His XREF and Screens documentation, plus his exploration of tools like Copilot for troubleshooting, shows he's thinking about how to make the whole team more productive, not just himself.

### Results Focus
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Manager Comments:**
Christopher keeps stakeholders informed without me having to remind him. When Product Owners ask about PBI status or Document Delivery Method progress, he responds promptly and with useful information. That kind of proactive communication makes everyone's job easier.

## Overall Assessment

Working with Christopher over the past year has shown me someone who genuinely cares about making things better for the whole team. He's not just focused on his own deliverables - he's thinking about the next person who has to understand the code, the new team member who needs to get up to speed, and the process improvements that would help everyone.

What I particularly value about Christopher is his systems thinking. He sees the gaps that slow us down and takes initiative to fix them. Whether it's documentation, sprint coordination, or onboarding processes, he approaches improvements systematically and follows through.

Christopher's ready for more leadership responsibility. He's already demonstrating the judgment and initiative I look for in a lead developer. With some focused development in technical architecture and strategic planning, he'll be well-positioned for expanded responsibilities.
