## Statistical Analysis and Distribution Assessment

### Current Distribution Analysis
- **Rating 5 (SE):** 2 employees (5.4%) - **BELOW TARGET** (should be ~3-4 employees)
- **Rating 4 (EE):** 3-5 employees (~8-14%) - **WITHIN RANGE**
- **Rating 3 (M):** 30+ employees (~81%) - **ABOVE TARGET** (should be ~70%)
- **Rating 2-3 (Development):** 1-2 employees (~3-5%) - **BELOW TARGET** (should be ~7-8 employees)

### Calibration Challenges Identified

#### 1. **Tenure Policy Impact**
- **10 exceptional performers** are artificially constrained to Rating 3 due to <6 months tenure
- **Actual distribution** would show 12 employees (32%) at Rating 4-5 level without tenure constraints
- **Recommendation:** Consider modified tenure policy or separate high-potential track

#### 2. **Rating Compression in Middle Band**
- **86.5% of employees** rated in Rating 3-4 range
- **Limited differentiation** between solid contributors and exceptional performers
- **Recommendation:** Apply more rigorous calibration to middle performers

#### 3. **Under-identification of Development Needs**
- **Only 8.1%** identified as needing development vs. 20% target
- **Possible grade inflation** or insufficient performance management
- **Recommendation:** More systematic identification of improvement opportunities

## Recommended Calibration Adjustments

### To Achieve Target Distribution (10/70/20):

#### **Elevate to Rating 5 (SE) - 2 additional employees needed:**
1. **Ian Abellana** - Currently constrained, exceptional AI leadership and infrastructure impact
2. **Ian Belmonte** - Currently constrained, revolutionary automation achievements

#### **Maintain Rating 4 (EE) - Current assignments appropriate:**
- Jay Mark Lagmay
- John Mark Arguilles  
- Christian Nailat
- James Aaron Constantino (estimated)
- Erwin Biglang-awa (estimated)

#### **Calibrate to Rating 3 (M) - Maintain current assignments:**
- Most solid contributors appropriately placed
- Monitor tenure-constrained high performers for future elevation

#### **Identify for Development Focus - Need 5-6 additional employees:**
**Candidates for closer performance monitoring:**
1. **Cleo Erika Soriano** - 0% achievement on strategic goals
2. **Janiel Apollo Bodiongan** - Limited AI/BFS engagement
3. **Verlin Grace Cabalhug** - Innovation adoption challenges
4. **Von Andrew Yao** - Limited strategic engagement, process improvement gaps
5. **[Review additional candidates for development planning]**
