## Overall Performance Summary

**Manager Rating: 3.0 - Meets Expectations (M) - Tenure Constrained**

Working with Patrick over his first several months at ABC Technology has been an interesting journey of watching someone adapt to our development environment. What I've observed is someone with genuine curiosity about AI technologies and a willingness to help teammates, but also someone who's still finding his rhythm in terms of consistent delivery patterns.

His self-evaluation rating of 3.0 shows good self-awareness, and I appreciate his honesty when he says he'll "strive harder to show my skills." That kind of growth mindset is exactly what we need. The gap I see isn't about capability - it's about establishing the reliability patterns that make someone truly dependable in our fast-paced environment.

**Overall Manager Rating:** 3.0

## Goals Assessment

### 1. Accelerating Banking & Financial Services Mastery & AI Innovation

**Target:** Position ABC Tech as center of excellence in Banking and Financial Services (BFS), and AI-powered innovation, enabling faster development, cost efficiency, and greater ownership of Axos strategic projects.

**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Achievement Highlights:**
- **AI Research Initiative:** Proactively researched Windsurf AI for OutSystems integration, showing genuine interest in emerging technologies
- **Strategic Curiosity:** Demonstrated desire to understand how AI can support team use-cases and development workflows

**Manager Comments:**
I'm genuinely impressed with Patrick's initiative in exploring Windsurf AI. When he mentioned researching AI tools for OutSystems, I could see his excitement about the possibilities. What I appreciate most is how he's not just looking at these tools as novelties - he's thinking about practical applications for our team.

The challenge I see is translating this research into concrete contributions. While his curiosity about AI is excellent and aligns with our strategic objectives, I need to see more evidence of how this learning converts into measurable improvements in his development work or helps the team adopt these tools effectively.

### 2. Empowered & Accountable Teams

**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Achievement Highlights:**
- **Team Support:** Actively helps colleagues through developing custom components and sharing technical solutions
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Provides suggestions on complex development matters when asked
- **Collaborative Approach:** Shows willingness to assist teammates with technical challenges

**Manager Comments:**
Patrick's desire to help the team through custom components and suggestions is something I value. I've seen him step up when colleagues have questions, and his approach is always respectful and thoughtful. He understands that being part of a team means contributing beyond just your individual tasks.

Where I'd like to see growth is in taking more proactive ownership of strategic deliverables. Right now, he's responsive when help is needed, but I'd love to see him identify opportunities to contribute before being asked. That shift from reactive to proactive support would really elevate his impact.

## Competencies Evaluation

### Dependability
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Needs Development (ND)**

Patrick believes the team can count on him for problem-solving, and I can see he genuinely wants to be reliable. His willingness to help and learn new technologies shows good character and team spirit.

However, what I've observed is inconsistency in delivery patterns that creates challenges for project planning. There have been instances where commitments weren't met or communication about potential delays came too late. This isn't about capability - Patrick has the skills. It's about establishing systems and habits that ensure consistent follow-through.

I know this is partly about being new to the organization, but building trust requires demonstrating reliability over time. I'm confident Patrick can get there with focused effort on communication and delivery tracking.

### Problem Solving/Analysis
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)**

Patrick says he's "always up for the challenge when thinking for solutions," and I've seen evidence of this. When complex issues arise, he approaches them thoughtfully and often helps colleagues work through critical solutions.

His analytical thinking is solid, and I appreciate that he doesn't just jump into problems randomly. He takes time to understand what's happening before proposing approaches. This systematic thinking will serve him well as he takes on more complex development challenges.

### Productivity
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)**

Patrick mentions delivering quality services earlier than expected, which gives him time for technology learning. I like this approach - using available time for continuous improvement rather than just moving to the next task.

His practice of reviewing and learning new technologies shows good productivity management. He's thinking beyond immediate deliverables to build capabilities that could benefit the team long-term. This forward-thinking approach to productivity is encouraging.

### Results Focus
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)**

I appreciate Patrick's focus on using extra time to learn things that can make our development process more efficient. That's exactly the kind of results-oriented thinking we need - not just completing tasks, but finding ways to improve how we work.

His commitment to looking for solutions that benefit the whole team shows he understands that individual results are part of larger team outcomes. This perspective will become more valuable as he gains experience and can contribute more strategic improvements.
