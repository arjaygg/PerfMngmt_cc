## Competencies Evaluation

### Dependability
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)**

Nenissa consistently demonstrates strong professional commitment, particularly under pressure. When product PBIs were delivered near sprint end (1-2 days before completion), she proactively engaged to deliver data model refinements ahead of schedule. Her approach shows genuine emotional investment in work quality and team success, creating an uplifting environment even during challenging timelines.

### Problem Solving/Analysis
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)**

Nenissa excels at breaking down complex data problems into manageable components. Her work on Account table column naming issues demonstrates systematic thinking - she analyzed impact, weighed alternatives, and implemented phased solutions. Her decision to prioritize AccountID to AccountNo changes while deferring more complex ID to AccountID changes shows practical problem-solving judgment.

### Productivity
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)**

Nenissa effectively manages multiple concurrent responsibilities including data modeling, research support for Product teams, and OS team assistance. Her ability to prioritize critical tasks (research, data model refinement, OS support) while maintaining progress across all areas demonstrates excellent time management and strategic thinking about work prioritization.

### Results Focus
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)**

Nenissa consistently delivers comprehensive work under tight deadlines. Her successful refinement of 11 product PBI data models near sprint end demonstrates strong results orientation.
