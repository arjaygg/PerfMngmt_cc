- Lead a lightweight improvement that removes recurring manual steps for the team
- Publish short “reference snippets” for common patterns to scale reuse

### Next 6–12 Months
- Participate regularly in design reviews; articulate trade-offs and options
- Strengthen cross-boundary diagnosis (service/data/infra) with structured runbooks
- Contribute to shared engineering standards and onboarding aids

---

## Recognition
- Dependable partner who turns commitments into stable outcomes
- Knowledge multiplier who accelerates peers with focused, reusable examples
- Calm presence who communicates early and prevents rework
