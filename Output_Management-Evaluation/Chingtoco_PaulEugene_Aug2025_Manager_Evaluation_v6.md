- **Productivity:** EE — Balances delivery and refactoring; volunteers improvements with thoughtful scope.  
- **Results Focus:** EE — On-time, concise implementations with accurate outcomes.  
- **Team Leadership (Emerging):** M — Influences through technical example; continue mentoring and design stewardship.

## Strategic Alignment and 9-Box
- Alignment to BFS & Engineering Excellence: quality and maintainability improvements directly support DX metrics and lower rework.  
- 9-Box: Solid Performance / Growth Potential based on current scope and emerging architectural leadership. Development focus will shift potential upward.

## Bias and Consistency Checks
- Tenure check: > 12 months; no cap.  
- Role parity: Consistent with Sr. Developer peer group distribution.  
- Self vs manager: Self 3.46 (M); manager-calibrated 3.0 (M) — rationale: distribution balance and consistency across similar roles.

## Development Focus and Specific Actions
- Architecture stewardship: publish NACHA refactor pattern, sample tests, and migration steps.  
- Quality gates: add coverage thresholds and static analysis rules; mentor adoption within squad.  
- Cross-functional impact: lead two design deep-dives next quarter to align platform patterns across teams.  
- Mentoring: pair with two developers to upskill on refactoring and testing strategy.

## Recognition / Retention Actions
- Recognition: call-out for architectural refactor impact and preventative quality outcomes in engineering forum.

## Manager’s Assessment Summary
Paul delivered solid, dependable performance with standout contributions in preventative quality and architecture modernization. Focused development on pattern codification, risk signaling, and cross-squad enablement will amplify impact without altering current delivery reliability.
