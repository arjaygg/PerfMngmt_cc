## Performance Rating Discussion

### Development Areas Identification

**Manager:**
"Your overall performance rating is 2.8 - Needs Development. I want to be clear that this rating reflects specific areas where we need to see improvement, and it's important that we address these directly while also identifying the support and resources you need to succeed.

**Areas Requiring Development:**

**Goal Achievement Consistency:**
Your goal achievement has been inconsistent, with some objectives not meeting expected timelines or quality standards. We need to work together to improve planning, execution, and delivery consistency.

**Execution and Follow-Through:**
There have been instances where execution has been inconsistent, affecting project timelines and team coordination. This is an area where structured support and development can make a significant difference.

**Financial and Resource Management:**
Some challenges have emerged in resource management and budget consciousness. This is a skill area that can be developed through training and structured guidance.

**Why This Rating and Development Focus:**
This rating is not a judgment on your potential or value as a team member. It's a development opportunity that allows us to identify specific areas for improvement and provide targeted support to help you succeed."
