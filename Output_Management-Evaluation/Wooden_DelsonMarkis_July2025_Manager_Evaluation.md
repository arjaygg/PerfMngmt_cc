## Goals Assessment

### Accelerating Banking & Financial Services Mastery & AI Innovation
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Achievement Level:** 50%

**Manager Comments:**
I've seen Delson really start to think beyond just "getting the job done" to understanding how our infrastructure work connects to the bigger picture. When he came to me with the idea for Preview environments using Kubernetes and ArgoCD, I could tell he'd been thinking about this for a while - he had already mapped out how it would solve real pain points our developers were facing. What I appreciate is that he didn't just build a cool technical solution; he thought through the actual workflow improvements it would deliver. That kind of strategic thinking is exactly what I want to see more of from him.

### Build On-Prem Kubernetes
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Achievement Level:** 100%

**Manager Comments:**
This was a big win for Delson and honestly exceeded my expectations. What impressed me wasn't just that he finished the EKS migration early, but how he approached it. I watched him methodically test everything with Rancher, deploying demo apps and really validating each step before moving forward. He'd come to our weekly check-ins with detailed progress updates and would flag potential issues before they became problems. When the APW team had questions about the new environment, Delson already had answers ready. That's the kind of proactive ownership that makes my job easier and gives me confidence in his work.

### Empowered & Accountable Teams
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)  
**Achievement Level:** 100%

**Manager Comments:**
This is where Delson really shines, and it's something I've observed consistently over the past few months. He has this patient way of explaining complex technical concepts that makes him a natural teacher. I've watched him work with the APW and CAPI developers, and what stands out is how he doesn't just show them what to do - he makes sure they understand why. When team members now confidently manage their own ArgoCD deployments and troubleshoot pipeline issues, that's directly because of the time Delson invested in teaching them properly. He's built real capability in our teams, not just dependency on him.

### Environment Stability & Reliability
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Achievement Level:** 85%

**Manager Comments:**
I'll be honest - this was an area where I had to push Delson initially. He's naturally more focused on solving technical problems than documenting processes. But once he understood how the ServiceNow tracking would help both of us manage workload better, he really embraced it. Now I can see exactly what he's working on and help prioritize when urgent requests come in. It's made our team much more predictable and reduced those last-minute fire drills we used to have.

### Systems Availability
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Achievement Level:** 90%

**Manager Comments:**
What I really appreciate about Delson is that he takes system uptime personally. He's established this weekly maintenance routine where he updates clusters and patches nodes during off-hours, and I rarely have to remind him about it. When I check our availability metrics, the Kubernetes clusters he manages consistently show excellent uptime. The development teams have come to expect that their environments will just work, and that's because Delson makes sure they do. That reliability is invaluable to our operations.

## Competencies Assessment

### Dependability
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Manager Comments:**
Delson is someone I can count on, period. When I assign him infrastructure work or deployment tasks, I don't worry about whether they'll get done - they will. He works well independently on complex projects like the EKS and Terraform work, but what I really value is how he handles our on-call rotations. He never complains, responds quickly to issues, and often helps teammates even when it's not his turn. That EC2 environment he spun up for APW in under a week is a perfect example - when they came to us with an urgent need, Delson just rolled up his sleeves and made it happen.

### Problem Solving/Analysis
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (EE)

**Manager Comments:**
This is probably Delson's strongest skill - his ability to methodically work through complex technical problems. I've watched him tackle some really challenging containerization issues, and he has this systematic way of isolating problems that consistently leads to solutions. When the ALF API deployment was failing, he didn't just try random fixes - he traced through the issue step by step until he found that localhost hardcoding. Same thing with the Clearing API containerization problems. He identified that outdated base image issue that could have taken other engineers days to find. The development teams have learned to trust his diagnostic skills, and honestly, so have I.

### Productivity
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Manager Comments:**
One thing I've noticed about Delson is that he naturally thinks about how to make work easier for everyone, not just himself. He'll solve a problem once, then create scripts or templates so the team doesn't have to solve it again. His pipeline templates are a great example - instead of everyone building deployment pipelines from scratch, they can now use his templates and get up and running much faster. It's this kind of thinking that makes him valuable beyond just his individual contributions.

### Results Focus
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)

**Manager Comments:**
What I appreciate about Delson is that when he commits to delivering something, he follows through completely. He doesn't just get the technical work done - he makes sure it's done right and that it actually solves the problem it was supposed to solve. When he led the Clearing API containerization effort, he took full ownership from start to finish. He coordinated with the development team, handled all the technical challenges, and saw it through to successful deployment. That's the kind of ownership and follow-through I want to see from all my team members.

## Development Recommendations

### Short-term (Next 6 months)
I want Delson to focus on expanding his influence and impact:
- Take the lead on planning our next major infrastructure initiative - I'll give him the resources and support he needs
- Document the Kubernetes management procedures he's developed - this knowledge needs to be shareable
- Build out that monitoring and alerting framework he's been thinking about - now's the time to make it happen
- Own our infrastructure security compliance program - he already does much of this work, now make it official

### Long-term (6-24 months)
I see Delson growing into senior technical leadership:
- Senior DevOps Engineer role is definitely in his future if he continues this trajectory
- I want him leading evaluation of new technologies and making recommendations to the broader team
- Cloud-native security expertise would make him incredibly valuable as we continue our modernization
- Start mentoring junior engineers - his teaching skills are natural and need to be leveraged more

## Overall Assessment

Working with Delson over these past 21 months has been genuinely rewarding. He's evolved from someone who primarily focused on executing technical tasks to someone who thinks strategically about how infrastructure supports our broader goals. What I value most about Delson is his combination of technical competence and genuine care for team success - he doesn't just solve his own problems, he solves problems for everyone.

I've seen him grow in confidence, particularly in how he approaches complex projects like the Kubernetes migration and Clearing API containerization. He now comes to me with well-thought-out plans rather than just asking for direction. His natural teaching ability has made our whole team stronger, and his reliability gives me the confidence to assign him increasingly important work.

The thing that impresses me most about Delson is his thoughtful approach to problem-solving. He doesn't rush to solutions - he takes time to understand the real issues and builds lasting fixes. That's exactly the kind of infrastructure thinking we need as we continue modernizing our systems.
