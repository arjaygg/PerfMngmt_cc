## Calibration Reconciliation

**Calibration Rationale:**
Erwin's calibrated rating of 3.7 reflects strong development leadership with team empowerment impact, balanced within the middle 70% distribution requirement. While his actual performance demonstrates exceptional leadership emergence and process innovation worthy of higher recognition, calibration constraints place him appropriately within the Exceeds Expectations band.

**Distribution Consideration:**
- Positioned in the upper-middle tier of the 70% distribution
- Recognition of leadership transition excellence while maintaining calibration fairness
- Future trajectory suggests advancement to higher performance band post formal leadership recognition

**Action for Rating Gap:**
The gap between potential performance (4.0+) and calibrated rating (3.7) will be addressed through:
- Formal leadership role transition to Dev Lead or Technical Lead
- Enhanced organizational visibility through cross-functional initiatives
- Retention bonus consideration for exceptional process innovations
