### Competencies Ratings
- **Dependability:** M (Meets Expectations)
  - Manager comment: Joshua communicates early and follows through. He closes the loop on issues and is clear about progress and risks, which helps the team plan with fewer surprises.
  - Observed behaviors: early risk surfacing; clear, timely updates to maintain team flow

- **Problem Solving and Analysis:** M (Meets Expectations)
  - Manager comment: He decomposes work into understandable steps and validates assumptions before moving forward. When he explains an approach, he does it plainly and invites feedback, which keeps solutions grounded and collaborative.
  - Observed behaviors: decomposes scenarios; explains reasoning plainly when sharing solutions

- **Productivity:** M (Meets Expectations)
  - Manager comment: Joshua maintains a steady cadence and avoids overengineering. He writes maintainable automation and captures edge cases, which keeps downstream effort low and results consistent.
  - Observed behaviors: focuses on maintainable automation; documents patterns and edge cases

- **Results Orientation:** M (Meets Expectations)
  - Manager comment: He ties actions to stakeholder needs and verifies outcomes before handoff. When something breaks, he corrects the root cause and confirms the fix holds.
  - Observed behaviors: closes issues with corrective actions and verifies outcomes before handoff

- **Leadership (IC Scope):** M (Meets Expectations)
  - Manager comment: Joshua models helpful behaviors—sharing working examples, answering questions, and creating simple artifacts others can reuse. A natural next step is to speak up earlier in discussions so the team benefits from his perspective sooner.
  - Observed behaviors: shares scripts on request; answers questions with clear, reusable examples
