# Manager Performance Evaluation
## Cleo Erika Soriano - DevOps Engineer
**Review Period:** January 1, 2025 - June 30, 2025  
**Manager:** Arjay Gallentes  
**Employee Tenure:** 6.7 months (Hired: December 9, 2024)  
**Project Assignment:** Clearing Team (DevOps - Pipeline Deployment & Testing)

---

## Executive Summary

I've been working with Cleo Erika for almost seven months now, and what consistently impresses me is her willingness to adapt to whatever the team needs. When we needed someone to cover US off-hours support, she didn't hesitate - she adjusted her entire schedule multiple times to make sure our operations ran smoothly. That kind of flexibility and team-first attitude tells me everything about her character.

Her technical foundation is solid, and I've watched her take ownership of critical processes like UAT Regression Testing with quiet reliability. However, I'll be honest - we need to see more strategic initiative from her. The 0% achievement on strategic goals isn't just a number on paper; it represents missed opportunities for both her growth and our team's advancement.

**Overall Performance Rating: 3.2/5.0 (Meets Expectations)**

## Goals Assessment

### Accelerating Banking & Financial Services Mastery & AI Innovation
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Below Expectations (BE)  
**Achievement Level:** 0% (Target: 30%)

**Manager Comments:**
This is where I need to be direct with Cleo Erika. Her day-to-day work is solid - she keeps our pipelines running and deploys what's needed. But when I look at her contributions to our strategic initiatives, I'm not seeing the proactive engagement we need. She's explored some automation tools, which is good, but we need her to dive deeper into BFS-specific improvements and really embrace AI-powered innovation. I know she has more to offer, and I want to help her find ways to contribute more strategically to our goals.

### Empowered & Accountable Teams
**Employee Self-Rating:** Meets Expectations (M)  
**Manager Rating:** Below Expectations (BE)  
**Achievement Level:** 0% (Target: 80%)

**Manager Comments:**
Here's what I appreciate about Cleo Erika - she takes ownership of what's assigned to her and collaborates well with our US teams. The pipeline deployment and testing work gets done reliably. But I'm concerned about the 0% achievement on this goal because it suggests she's not yet ready to drive initiatives beyond her assigned tasks. I need to see her step up and take more ownership of team-wide strategic initiatives, not just execute what's handed to her. The potential is there - I just need to help her see it and act on it.

## Overall Assessment

In my six-plus months working with Cleo Erika, I've come to appreciate her reliability and adaptability - qualities that any manager values. When schedules needed to change to support our US operations, she made it work without complaint. When critical testing processes needed an owner, she stepped up. That's the foundation of good performance.

But here's where I need to be honest as her manager: operational reliability alone won't advance her career or maximize her impact on our team. The 0% achievement on strategic goals is a wake-up call for both of us. She has good technical skills and a collaborative spirit, but I need to help her understand that taking initiative on strategic initiatives isn't optional - it's essential for growth.

I genuinely believe Cleo Erika has more to offer than she's currently showing. Her willingness to adapt and learn gives me confidence that with the right guidance and accountability, she can develop into the strategic contributor we need. But it's going to require her to step outside her comfort zone and take ownership of bigger challenges.

**Final Rating: 3.2/5.0 (Meets Expectations with Development Opportunities)**

---

## Manager Recommendation

**Recommend focused development support in strategic initiative ownership and BFS domain knowledge, with clear performance improvement plan for achieving measurable strategic contributions. Strong operational foundation indicates good potential for advancement with targeted strategic development.**
